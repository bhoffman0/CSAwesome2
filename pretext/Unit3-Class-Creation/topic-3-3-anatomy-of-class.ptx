  <title>Anatomy of a Java Class</title><introduction>
    
    <p>In Unit 2, we learned to use <term>classes</term> and <term>objects</term> that are built-in to
            Java or written by other programmers. In this unit, you will learn to write your
            own classes and make your own objects!</p>
    <p>Remember that a <term>class</term> in Java defines a blueprint for creating objects. When
            you create <term>objects</term>, you create new <term>instances</term> of that class and what you
            can do with those instances is determined by what methods are defined in the
            class.</p>
    <p>For example in Unit 2, we created <c>yertle</c> and <c>myrtle</c>, 2 <c>Turtle</c>
            variables and assigned them references to objects created from the class
            <c>Turtle</c> and we used instances of Java’s <c>String</c> class to assign values to
            different <c>String</c> variables.</p>

  <subsection>
            <title>Creating a Class</title>
            <p>Most classes you write will have the keyword <c>public</c> before them though it is
                not required. The class definition itself always starts with the word <c>class</c>
                followed by the name of the class. Then the rest of the class, called the body,
                is defined inside a pair of <c>{}</c>s.</p>
            <p>Since we’re talking about anatomy, let’s create a class called <c>Person</c>.
                Classes are almost always named with capitalized names though this is a matter
                of style, not a rule of the language. Here is the basic skeleton of a <c>Person</c>
                class:</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
public class Person
{
    // define class here - also called the “body” of the class

}
</input></program>
            <p>You can create instances of the <c>Person</c> class with <c>new</c> as in <c>new
Person()</c> And you can declare variables that can hold a reference to a
                <c>Person</c> object with <c>Person variableName</c>.</p>
            <p>Or put it altogether to declare some variables and initialize each one with a
                reference to a new <c>Person</c> as shown here.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
Person ada = new Person();
Person charles = new Person();
</input></program>
            <p>So what makes up the body of the class—the stuff between the <c>{}</c>s?</p>
            <p>Remember that objects have both attributes and behaviors. These correspond to
                <term>instance variables</term> and <term>methods</term> in the class definition.</p>
            <p>The first things we define in a class are usually the instance variables. They
                are called that because each instance of the class (each object) has its own set
                of variables that aren’t shared with other instances. This is what allowed
                <c>yertle</c> and <c>myrtle</c> from Unit 2 to be at different positions at the same
                time; they each had their own x position and y position instance variables.</p>
            <p>The next thing we define in a class is usually its <term>constructors</term>. We’ll talk
                about writing constructors in more detail in the next section but a
                constructor’s job is to initialize the instance variables when the object is
                created. Usually that will mean they need to take arguments. (The call to <c>new
Person()</c> before is to a constructor that doesn’t take any arguments. In a
                moment we’ll see that our <c>Person</c> constructor will actually need arguments.)</p>
            <p>The real meat of a class is in the <term>methods</term> which define the behaviors of the
                objects of that class. Recall from Unit 2 that most methods either do things
                (like the <c>Turtle</c> methods that moved the turtle on the screen) or return
                values like the <c>getXPos</c> and <c>getYPos</c> on <c>Turtle</c>.</p>
            <p>The methods of the class share access to the object’s instance variables and
                when a method is called on an object it uses the instance variables for that
                object. For example in the <c>Turtle</c> class the <c>forward</c> method changes an
                instance variable <c>xPos</c>. When you call <c>forward</c> on <c>yertle</c> it changes
                <c>xPos</c> on the <c>yertle</c> object and when you call it on <c>myrtle</c> it changes
                the <c>xPos</c> on the <c>myrtle</c> object.</p>
            <p>Putting it all together, the three main anatomical features of a class are the
                <term>instance variables</term> which hold values associated with each object, the
                <term>constructors</term> whose job is to initialize the instance variables, and the
                <term>methods</term> who contain the code that gives the objects their behavior and which
                can use the instance variables defined in the class.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
public class Person
{
    // instance variables

    // constructors

    // methods

}
</input></program>
            <p>And finally one last bit of weird anatomy, kind of like the appendix: any Java
                class can have a <c>main</c> method which can be used to run that class as a
                program either to test that one class or sometimes as the entry point to a whole
                program made up of many classes and objects.</p>

  <subsection>
            <title>Designing a Class</title>
            <p>Now that we know what the skeleton of a class looks like and the elements that
                make up the body of the class, we’re ready to create our own class. Let’s start
                with a quick look at how to design a class such as <c>Person</c>.</p>
            <p>One important question we have to ask when designing a class is, what data does
                it represent? In this case we can ask, what would we want to know about a
                person? Our answer will depend on what problem we are trying to solve. In one
                program, perhaps an address book, we might want to know the person’s name and
                phone number and email. In another program, such as a medical application, we
                might need to know their vital signs such as their blood pressure, temperature,
                and pulse rate.</p>
            <p>For now let’s go with the address book example. Here’s a fleshed out <c>Person</c>
                class with instance variables, a constructor, and methods. We’ll go through the
                details in the next few sections but for now you can run the code to see how it
                constructs 2 <c>Person</c> objects and fills in their data.</p>
            <p>Remember that execution always starts in the <c>main</c> method. When a method like
                <c>print</c> is called, the code defined in the method runs but when it gets the
                values of <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>, and <c>phoneNumber</c> it gets the specific values
                of those variables that were set by the constructor when the particular object
                we called <c>print</c> on was created. Click on the Show CodeLens button below and
                the Next button to run the code step by step.</p>

            <title>Instance Variables</title>
            
            
            <p>As we’ve said, <term>instance Variables</term> hold the data for an object. They record
                what an object needs to know to play its role in the program. Instance variables
                are also sometimes called <term>attributes</term>, <term>fields</term>, or <term>properties</term>.</p>
            <p>In general and definitely on the AP CSA exam, instance variables should be
                declared <term>private</term>. Think of <c>private</c> as like your diary. Only you should
                have direct access to it. Similarly, in Java a <c>private</c> instance variable can
                only be accessed by code in the class that declares the variable.</p>
            <note>
                <p>Instance variables are declared right after the class declaration.  They usually start with <c>private</c> then the <em>type</em> of the variable and then a <em>name</em> for the variable. Private means only the code in this class has access to it.</p>
            </note>
            <p>The <c>Person</c> class declares 3 private instance variables: <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>,
                and <c>phoneNumber</c>. These are things that you might want to know about a
                person. They are declared at the top of the class and they exist inside the <c>{
}</c> of the class.</p>
            <p>Once we have created a class like <c>Person</c>, we can create many instances
                (objects) of the class. The class is like a blueprint or cookie cutter that
                defines the variables and methods for that class. Each object will have their
                own copies of the same instance variables but with possibly different values in
                them (as seen in the cookie decorations below).</p>
            <figure align="center"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Person Class and Objects</caption><image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/PersonClassWithCookies.png" width="100%%" alt="Person data encapsulation"/></figure>
            <p>Good Java style stresses <term>data encapsulation</term> where the data (instance
                variables) and the code acting on the data (methods) are wrapped together into a
                single unit and the implementation details are hidden. Because only code in the
                class can access or change the values of <c>private</c> instance variables it is a
                lot easier to keep track of how your program works than if you had to worry that
                any code anywhere in a much larger program could possibly change the values of
                the variables.</p>
            <p>Code in other classes can only interact with the <c>public</c> methods you provide
                and cannot directly access the <c>private</c> instance variables (shown in the pink
                box above).</p>
            <p>When designing a class you get to decide what data to make accessible or
                modifiable from other classes by what <c>public</c> methods you provide. (Remember
                from Unit 2 how the <c>Turtle</c> class provided <c>getXPos</c> and <c>getYPos</c> to get
                the turtle’s position but no <c>setXPos</c> and <c>setYPos</c> since the only way to
                move a turtle is through  <c>forward</c> and <c>moveTo</c> methods?)</p>

  <subsection>
            <title>Methods</title>
            
            
            <p>Now to <term>methods</term> which define what we can actually do with an object. The most
                important methods in a class are the <c>public</c> methods since they can be
                accessed from outside the class. You may also write <c>private</c> methods that are
                not accessible outside of the class and therefore can only be used by other
                methods inside the same class. As you’ve probably figured out, the <c>public</c>
                and <c>private</c> keywords determine the external access and visibility of
                classes, instance variables, constructors, and methods.</p>
            <note>
                <p>Methods define what the object can do. They typically start with <c>public</c>
                    then a type, then the name of the method followed by parentheses for optional
                    parameters. Methods defined for an object can access and use its instance
                    variables!</p>
            </note>
            <p>The <c>Person</c> class above has a <c>print</c> method that prints out all the data
                stored for a person object. Notice that it is marked as <c>public</c> and after
                <c>public</c> comes the return type. The <c>void</c> return type, as you may recall
                from Unit 2, is used to indicate that the method does not return anything but
                has some effect such as printing to the screen. After the return type comes the
                method name followed by parentheses containing the list of parameters. In this
                case there are no parameters but we still need the <c>()</c>s. The body of the
                method is in <c>{}</c>s. As we’ve discussed, the method can access and use the
                instance variables defined in the class: <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>, and
                <c>phoneNumber</c> but will get the values specific to the object we called
                <c>print</c> on.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
public void print()
{
  System.out.println("Name: " + name);
  System.out.println("Email: " + email);
  System.out.println("Phone Number: " + phoneNumber);
}
</input></program>
            <p>To call a method, we need an object that is an instance of the class such as we
                get by calling its constructor. Then we use the dot (<c>.</c>) operator to call its
                <c>public</c> methods, for example <c>p1.print()</c> means call the <c>print</c> method
                on the object <c>p1</c>.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
// call the constructor to create a new person
Person p1 = new Person("Sana", "sana@gmail.com", "123-456-7890");
// call p1's print method
p1.print();

            <title>Object-Oriented Design</title>
            <p>So far we’ve just talked about designing one class. In <term>object-oriented
                    design</term> (OOD), programmers often start by deciding which classes are needed to
                solve a problem and then figure out the data and methods in each class.</p>
            <p>When you are given a problem specification, you can identify classes you’ll need
                by looking for the <term>nouns</term> in the specification. For instance, the
                specification for the turtle graphics system from Unit 2 probably contained a
                sentence that said something like, “there are turtles that can exist on a
                2-dimensional world and can draw lines by moving around the world”. The main
                nouns in that description are “turtle” and “world” and indeed the classes in the
                system are <c>Turtle</c> and <c>World</c>. (The one noun that was not turned into a
                class was “line”. Do you think it would have made sense to create a <c>Line</c>
                class? Why or why not?)</p>
            <p>Once you’ve determined the classes you need, then you can go through the process
                we described above to design the individual classes. Note that you can often
                identify methods that should exist on classes by looking for verbs in the

            <p>Sometimes it’s useful, when designing a complex system with lots of classes, to
                make diagrams of the classes that show you at a glance what instance variables
                and methods they have. Often these can just be sketches in your notebook or on a
                whiteboard but there are also more formal systems such as the Unified Modeling
                Language (UML) for drawing these diagrams.</p>
            <p>For example, here is a UML class diagram for the <c>Turtle</c> class. The <c>-</c> in
                front of the attributes indicate that they are private, and the <c>+</c> in front
                of the methods indicate that they are public. Here is a <problematic refid="id8">|tutorial on class
                    diagrams|</problematic> that explains it in more detail if you are curious (Class diagrams are
                not on the AP CSA exam). If you want to draw your own, <url href="https://app.diagrams.net/" visual="https://app.diagrams.net/">app.diagrams.net</url> or
                <url href="https://creately.com" visual="https://creately.com">Creately.com</url> are good free online drawing tools for UML class diagrams.</p>

<exercise label="OOD1">
    <statement>
            <p> You’ve been hired by your school to create a program that keeps track of “students at your school and the courses they are taking”. Name 2 classes that you would create in your program. Name 2 attributes (data kept in instance variables) for each class.</p>

    </statement>
</exercise>
            <p>The two nouns in the problem description above, <term>Student</term> and <term>Course</term> would make good class names! Then, you can think about what data you need to keep track of for students and courses and what methods you need. Note that the instance variables in the Person class could also work for a Student class!</p>

<exercise label="OOD2">
    <statement>
            <p> Say you wanted to make a computer game from a board game that you are playing. Think about what objects are in the game. For example, here is the description for Monopoly (trademark Hasbro games): “Buy, sell, dream and scheme your way to riches. Players buy, sell and trade to win. Build houses and hotels on your properties and bankrupt your opponents to win it all. Chance and Community Chest cards can change everything.” What classes would you need to create a computer version of this game? (Remember to look for the nouns). Take one of the classes you listed, and try to come up with 2 pieces of data in that class that will be the instance variables.</p>

            <title>Programming Challenge : Riddle Class</title>
            <image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/chicken.png" width="23%%" alt="Chicken"/>
            <p>In this project, you will create a class that can tell riddles like the following:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Riddle Question: Why did the chicken cross the playground?</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Riddle Answer: To get to the other slide!</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p><ol marker="1">
                <li>
                    <p>First, brainstorm in pairs to create an <term>object-oriented design</term> for a riddle asking program. What should we call this class? What data does it need to keep track of in instance variables? What is the data type for the instance variables? What methods do we need? (You could draw a Class Diagram for this class using <url href="https://app.diagrams.net/" visual="https://app.diagrams.net/">app.diagrams.net</url> or <url href="https://creately.com" visual="https://creately.com">Creately.com</url>, although it is not required).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Using the <c>Person</c> class above as a guide, write a <c>Riddle</c> class in the Active Code template below that has 2 instance variables for the riddle’s question and answer, a constructor that initializes the riddle, and 2 methods to ask the riddle and answer the riddle. Don’t name your instance variables <c>initQuestion</c> and <c>initAnswer</c> since they are used as constructor parameter variables. If you came up with other instance variables and methods for this class, you can add those too! Don’t forget to specify the <c>private</c> or <c>public</c> access modifiers. Use the outline in the Active Code below. You will learn how to write constructors and other methods in detail in the next lessons.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Complete the <c>main</c> method to construct at least 2 <c>Riddle</c> objects that call the <c>Riddle</c> constructor with the arguments for the riddle question and answer and call their <c>printQuestion</c> and <c>printAnswer</c> methods to ask and answer the riddle. You can look up some good riddles online.</p>

            <p>In this unit, you will design a class of your own choice that is relevant to your community.
                You will improve the class in each lesson of this unit. We suggest that you work in pairs on this project.
