  <title>Anatomy of a Java Class</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In Unit 1, we learned to use <term>classes</term> and <term>objects</term>
      that are built-in to Java or written by other programmers. In this unit,
      you will learn to write your own classes and make your own objects!
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that a <term>class</term> in Java defines a blueprint for
      creating objects. When you create <term>objects</term>, you create new
      <term>instances</term> of that class and what you can do with those
      instances is determined by what methods are defined in the class.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, we created <c>yertle</c> and <c>myrtle</c>, 2 <c>Turtle</c>
      variables and assigned them references to objects created from the class
      <c>Turtle</c> and we used instances of Java’s <c>String</c> class to
      assign values to different <c>String</c> variables.
    </p>

    <title>Parts of a Class</title>
    <p>
      Most classes you write will have the keyword <c>public</c> before them
      though it is not required. The class definition itself always starts with
      the word <c>class</c> followed by the name of the class. Then the rest of
      the class, called the body, is defined inside a pair of <c>{}</c>s.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we’re talking about anatomy, let’s create a class called
      <c>Person</c>. Classes are almost always named with capitalized names
      though this is a matter of style, not a rule of the language. In this
      course, classes are always designated <c>public</c> and are declared with
      the keyword <c>class</c>. Here is the basic skeleton of a <c>Person</c>
      class:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class Person
{
    // define class here - also called the “body” of the class

}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      You can create instances of the <c>Person</c> class with <c>new</c> as in
      <c>new Person()</c> And you can declare variables that can hold a
      reference to a <c>Person</c> object with <c>Person variableName</c>. Or
      put it altogether to declare some variables and initialize each one with a
      reference to a new <c>Person</c> as shown here.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
Person ada = new Person();
Person charles = new Person();
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      So what makes up the body of the class — the stuff between the <c>{}</c>s?
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that objects have both attributes and behaviors. These correspond
      to <term>instance variables</term> and <term>methods</term> in the class
      definition. The first things we define in a class are usually the instance
      variables. They are called that because each instance of the class (each
      object) has its own set of variables that aren’t shared with other
      instances. This is what allowed <c>yertle</c> and <c>myrtle</c> from to be
      at different positions at the same time; they each had their own x
      position and y position instance variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next thing we define in a class is usually its
      <term>constructors</term>. We’ll talk about writing constructors in more
      detail in the next section but a constructor’s job is to initialize the
      instance variables when the object is created. In this course,
      constructors are always designated <c>public</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real meat of a class is in the <term>methods</term> which define the
      behaviors of the objects of that class. Remember that most methods either
      do things (like the <c>Turtle</c> methods that moved the turtle on the
      screen) or return values like the <c>getXPos</c> and <c>getYPos</c> on
      <c>Turtle</c>. The methods of the class share access to the object’s
      instance variables and when a method is called on an object it uses the
      instance variables for that object. For example in the <c>Turtle</c> class
      the <c>forward</c> method changes an instance variable <c>xPos</c>. When
      you call <c>forward</c> on <c>yertle</c> it changes <c>xPos</c> on the
      <c>yertle</c> object and when you call it on <c>myrtle</c> it changes the
      <c>xPos</c> on the <c>myrtle</c> object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Putting it all together, the three main anatomical features of a class are
      the <term>instance variables</term> which hold values associated with each
      object, the <term>constructors</term> whose job is to initialize the
      instance variables, and the <term>methods</term> who contain the code that
      gives the objects their behavior and which can use the instance variables
      defined in the class.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class Person
{
    // instance variables

    // constructors

    // methods

}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      And finally one last bit of weird anatomy, kind of like the appendix: any
      Java class can have a <c>main</c> method which can be used to run that
      class as a program either to test that one class or sometimes as the entry
      point to a whole program made up of many classes and objects.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="designing-a-class">
    <title>Designing a Class</title>
    <p>
      Now that we know what the skeleton of a class looks like and the elements
      that make up the body of the class, we’re ready to create our own class.
      Let’s start with a quick look at how to design a class such as
      <c>Person</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One important question we have to ask when designing a class is, what data
      does it represent? In this case we can ask, what would we want to know
      about a person? Our answer will depend on what problem we are trying to
      solve. In one program, perhaps an address book, we might want to know the
      person’s name and phone number and email. In another program, such as a
      medical application, we might need to know their vital signs such as their
      blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now let’s go with the address book example. Here’s a fleshed out
      <c>Person</c> class with instance variables, a constructor, and methods.
      We’ll go through the details in the next few sections but for now you can
      run the code to see how it constructs 2 <c>Person</c> objects and fills in
      their data. Remember that execution always starts in the <c>main</c>
      method. When a method like <c>print</c> is called, the code defined in the
      method runs but when it gets the values of <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>, and
      <c>phoneNumber</c> it gets the specific values of those variables that
      were set by the constructor when the particular object we called
      <c>print</c> on was created. Click on the Show CodeLens button below and
      the Next button to run the code step by step.
    </p>

    <activity label="PersonClass">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following Person class keeps track of the name, email, and phone
          number of a person. Try changing the Person p2 object in the main
          method to your name. Click on the Show CodeLens button and then Next
          to step through the code.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
        <code>
public class Person
{
    // instance variables
    private String name;
    private String email;

  <subsection xml:id="data-encapsulation">
    <title>Data encapsulation</title>
    <p>
      <term>Data encapsulation</term> is an object-oriented design technique in
      which the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from external
      classes. The keywords <c>public</c> and <c>private</c> are called
      <term>access modifiers</term>, and they affect how you can the access
      classes, data, constructors, and methods. The keyword <c>public</c> means
      anyone can access this; it allows access from classes outside the
      declaring class. The keyword <c>private</c> restricts access to the
      declaring class which means that variables or methods marked private are
      only accessible inside the class where they are defined. In general,
      instance variables in a class should be declared <c>private</c> to ensure
      data encapsulation.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="instance-variables">
    <title>Instance Variables</title>
    <idx>
      <h>class</h><h>instance variables</h>
    </idx>

    <p>
      <term>Instance Variables</term> (sometimes called <term>attributes</term>,
      <term>fields</term>, or <term>properties</term>) hold the data for an
      object. They belong to the object, and each object has its own copy of
      these variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general and definitely on the AP CSA exam, instance variables should be
      declared <term>private</term>. Think of <c>private</c> as like your diary.
      Only you should have direct access to it. Similarly, in Java a
      <c>private</c> instance variable can only be accessed by code inside the
      class that declares the variable.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Instance variables are declared right after the class declaration. They
        usually start with <c>private</c> then the <em>type</em> of the variable
        and then a <em>name</em> for the variable. Private means only the code
        in this class has access to it.
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      The <c>Person</c> class declares 3 private instance variables:
      <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>, and <c>phoneNumber</c>. These are things that
      you might want to know about a person. They are declared at the top of the
      class and they exist inside the <c>{ }</c> of the class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we have created a class like <c>Person</c>, we can create many
      instances (objects) of the class. The class is like a blueprint or cookie
      cutter that defines the variables and methods for that class. Each object
      will have their own copies of the same instance variables but with
      possibly different values in them (as seen in the cookie decorations
      below).
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Person Class and Objects</caption>
      <image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/PersonClassWithCookies.png" width="100%" alt="Person data encapsulation" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class in order to
      accomplish encapsulation. It is good programming practice to designate the
      instance variables as <title_reference>private</title_reference> in order
      to ensure <term>data encapsulation</term> where the data (instance
      variables) and the code acting on the data (methods) are wrapped together
      into a single unit and the implementation details are hidden. Only code in
      the class can access or change the values of <c>private</c> instance
      variables. This keeps the data secure and makes it a lot easier to keep
      track of how your program works than if you had to worry that any code
      anywhere in a much larger program could possibly change the values of the
      variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Code in other classes can only interact with the <c>public</c> methods you
      provide and cannot directly access the <c>private</c> instance variables
      (shown in the pink box above). When designing a class you get to decide
      what data to make accessible or modifiable from other classes by what
      <c>public</c> methods you provide.

    <title>Instance Methods</title>
    <idx>
      <h>class</h><h>method</h>
    </idx>

    <p>
      <term>Instance methods</term> define what we can actually do with an
      object, their behaviors and functions. These methods have direct access to
      the instance variables and can use them and change them to perform their
      tasks. In Unit 1, we used and wrote static class methods like
      <c>Math.random()</c> which were called with the classname. Instance
      methods are not marked static and are always called using an object of the
      class and can access the object’s instance variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Methods are defined in the class after the instance variables and
      constructors. They are usually marked as <c>public</c> so they can be
      accessed from inside or outside the class. Methods designated as
      <c>private</c> are not accessible outside of the class; they can only be
      used as helper methods by other methods inside the same class.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Methods define what the object can do. They typically start with
        <c>public</c> then a type, then the name of the method followed by
        parentheses for optional parameters. Methods defined for an object can
        access and use its instance variables!
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      The <c>Person</c> class above has a <c>print</c> method that prints out
      all the data stored for a person object. Notice that it is marked as
      <c>public</c> and after <c>public</c> comes the return type. The
      <c>void</c> return type is used to indicate that the method does not
      return anything but has some effect such as printing to the screen. After
      the return type comes the method name followed by parentheses containing
      the list of parameters. In this case there are no parameters but we still
      need the <c>()</c>s. The body of the method is in <c>{}</c>s. As we’ve
      discussed, the method can access and use the instance variables defined in
      the class: <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>, and <c>phoneNumber</c> but will get
      the values specific to the object we called <c>print</c> on.

}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      To call a method, we need an object that is an instance of the class such
      as we get by calling its constructor. Then we use the dot (<c>.</c>)
      operator to call its <c>public</c> methods, for example <c>p1.print()</c>
      means call the <c>print</c> method on the object <c>p1</c>.

    <title>Coding Challenge : Virtual Pet Class</title>
    <image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/virtualpet.jpg" width="23%" alt="Virtual Pet" />
    <p>
      In the late 1990s and early 2000s, digital pets like in the photo were a
      huge hit! You had to feed, play, and interact with your virtual pet in
      order to keep it healthy and happy. Let’s think about how they were
      programmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol marker="1">
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Design:</term> In pairs, brainstorm about the
            <term>object-oriented design</term> for the virtual pet. What data
            or instance variables would you need to keep track of for a virtual
            pet? What behaviors or methods would the virtual pet have? (You
            could draw a Class Diagram for this class using <url
            href="https://app.diagrams.net/"
            visual="https://app.diagrams.net/">app.diagrams.net</url> or <url
            href="https://creately.com"
            visual="https://creately.com">Creately.com</url>, although it is not
            required). Then, using the <c>Person</c> class above as a guide,
            write a <c>VirtualPet</c> class in the Active Code template below
            with the following parts.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Instance Variables</term>: Declare at least 3 instance
            variables in the <c>VirtualPet</c> class below. Two of the instance
            variables should be called <c>name</c> and <c>health</c> where
            health is a number from 0 to 10. The rest can be variables from your
            design above. Don’t forget to add in their <c>private</c> access
            modifiers.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Methods</term>: Complete the <c>print</c> method to print out
            the instance variables of the <c>VirtualPet</c> object, and complete
            the <c>feed</c> method to add 1 to the health instance variable.
            Remember that the methods have direct access to the instance
            variables. Create at least one more method that changes one of the
            instance variables from your design. (The constructor method and a
            get method is written for you below. You will learn how to write
            constructors in detail in the next lesson.)
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Complete the <c>main</c> method to construct at least 2
            <c>VirtualPet</c> objects that call the <c>VirtualPet</c>
            constructor given to you with arguments for name and health. Then,
            use at least one of the objects to call its <c>feed</c> and
            <c>print</c> methods.

            in a community organization or activity or to help your community.
            For example, you could create a Java class to keep track of
            community events, club activities, athletic games or statistics,
            community leaders, performers or performances, health tracking, or

            (AP 3.3.A.1) <term>Data encapsulation</term> is a technique in which
            the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from external
            classes.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 3.3.A.1) The keywords <c>public</c> and <c>private</c> affect
            the access of classes, data, constructors, and methods. The keyword
            <c>private</c> restricts access to the declaring class, while the
            keyword <c>public</c> allows access from classes outside the
            declaring class.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 3.3.A.2) In this course, classes are always designated
            <c>public</c> and are declared with the keyword <c>class</c>.

        <li>
          <p>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 3.3.A.4) <term>Instance variables</term> belong to the object,
            and each object has its own copy of the variables.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 3.3.A.5) Access to attributes should be kept internal to the
            class in order to accomplish encapsulation. Therefore, it is good
            programming practice to designate the instance variables for these
            attributes as <c>private</c> unless the class specification states
            otherwise.
