   <title>Free Response Question (FRQ) 2 Class Design - CupcakeMachine Class</title>

    <p>
      The AP exam’s second free response question (FRQ) is on classes, where
      students design and implement a described class. Students will be
      instructed to design and implement a class based on provided
      specifications and examples. A second class might also be included.
      Students will be provided with a scenario and specifications in the form
      of a table demonstrating ways to interact with the class and the results.
      The class must include a class header, instance variables, a constructor,
      a method, and implementation of the constructor and required method. Note that only 
      one constructor and one method are required. This question
      does not involve more complex topics such as arrays or inheritance (which is no longer on the exam).
    </p>

    <p>
      To succeed on the FRQ Question 2 on Classes, you must know how to:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a class using <c>public class Classname { }</c>
          </p>
        </li>
       <li>
          <p>
            Create private instance variables in the class based on the description. 
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Write a constructor with the same name as the class and no return
            type. This constructor will probably have one or more parameters that are
            assigned to instance variables. There is often another instance variable  
            that is not a parameter which is assigned a default value. 
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Write a public method in the class that uses the instance variables as
            well as parameters and return values. This method will probably
            use if statements but not more complex coding. This method 
            will probably change the values of the instance variables and 
            return a calculated value that is dependent on the
            instance variables.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <title>Cupcake Machine Description</title>
    <p>
     The <c>CupcakeMachine</c> class, which you will write, represents a
     cupcake vending machine, an automated machine that dispenses cupcakes.
     <c>CupcakeMachine</c> objects are created by calls to a constructor with two
parameters.
</p>
   <ul><li><p>
 The first parameter is an int that represents the number of cupcakes that the
 vending machine has been stocked with. Assume that this value will be greater
 than or equal to 0.
 </p></li>
 <li><p>
  The second parameter is a double that represents the cost, in dollars, per
  cupcake. Assume that this value will be greater than 0.0.
    </p></li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  The <c>CupcakeMachine</c> class contains a <c>takeOrder</c> method, which
determines whether a cupcake order can be filled. A cupcake order can be filled
if there are at least as many cupcakes in the vending machine as there are in the
order.</p>
<p>A cupcake order is represented by a single int parameter to the
<c>takeOrder</c> method. Assume that all values passed to the <c>takeOrder</c>
method are positive.</p>
 <p>
 If an order can be filled, the method updates the number of cupcakes remaining
in the machine and returns a String containing information about the order. 
The returned String contains the order number and the cost of the order, as shown in the following table.
Order numbers begin at 1 and increase by 1 for each order  filled.
</p>
<p>If the order cannot be filled because the vending machine does not have enough
cupcakes, the <c>takeOrder</c> method should return the message "Order
cannot be filled". In this case, the number of cupcakes available in the
machine is unchanged and no order number is given to the order.
</p>
<p>
The following table contains a sample code execution sequence and the 
corresponding results. The code execution sequence appears in a class other 
than <c>CupcakeMachine</c>

   <p>The constructor's parameters often determine the instance variables that you must create. 
       However, the AP exam often has another instance variable that is described in the problem 
       specification but not given as a parameter to the constructor. 
       During the exam, it helps to mark the words that are important and may describe the
       variables. Think about phrases that indicate a value that is being stored or
       changed or returned. Remember that instance variables are for the attributes of the class.
       Ask yourself whether a possible variable is a local variable that is just used within a method 
       or whether it is an attribute of the <c>CupcakeMachine</c> that needs to be stored and used   
       outside of the method.
    </p>

    <activity label="cupcake-instance-variables">
      <statement>

          Select the phrases from the problem specification below which probably mention an instance variable. 
          Some of the phrases may occur twice and describe the same variable.

              This is the parameter for the <c>takeOrder</c> method, but it is probably a local variable, not an instance variable. 
              We can use the parameter to calculate the cost of the order, but we do not need to store it as an instance variable 
              since it is not an attribute of the machine and is only used in the method and not outside of it.

    <title>Writing the CupcakeMachine Class</title> 

<p>Write the <c>CupcakeMachine</c> class below. The class must include a class header, instance variables, a constructor, and method as 
described in the problem specification.  The main method below which contains the code in the provided table 
shows how the constructor and method are used. During the AP exam, you can use the table to trace through your code to check that it 
generates the same results.

          Write the complete CupcakeMachine class. Your implementation must
          meet all specifications and conform to the examples shown in the table above 
          and in the main method below. It should include the class header, 
          instance variable declarations, a constructor, and a method as described in the main method.
