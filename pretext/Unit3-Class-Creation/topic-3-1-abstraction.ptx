  <title>Abstraction and Program Design</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In Unit 1, we learned to use <term>classes</term> and <term>objects</term>
      that are built-in to Java or written by other programmers, for example the
      <c>Turtle</c> class. In this unit, you will learn to write your own
      classes and make your own objects! Prior to implementing a class, it is
      helpful to take time to design each class including its attributes and
      behaviors. This design can be represented using natural language or
      diagrams. In this lesson, you will learn about abstraction and how it can
      be used to design a program.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="object-oriented-design">
    <title>Object-Oriented Design</title>
    <p>
      In <term>object-oriented design</term> (OOD), programmers often start by
      deciding which classes are needed to solve a problem and then figure out
      the data and methods in each class.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are given a problem specification, you can identify classes
      you’ll need by looking for the <term>nouns</term> in the specification.
      For instance, the specification for the Turtle class probably contained a
      sentence that said something like, “make turtles that can exist on a
      2-dimensional world and can draw lines by moving around the world”. The
      main nouns in that description are “turtle” and “world” and indeed the
      classes in the system are <c>Turtle</c> and <c>World</c>.
    </p>

    <activity label="OOD1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          You’ve been hired by your school to create a program that keeps track
          of “students at your school and the courses they are taking”. Name 2
          classes that you would create in your program. Name 2 attributes (data
          kept in instance variables) for each class.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <response />
    </activity>

    <p>
      The two nouns in the problem description above, <term>Student</term> and
      <term>Course</term> would make good class names! Then, you can think about
      what data you need to keep track of for students and courses and what
      methods you need. For example, for the Student class, you might need to
      keep track of the student’s name and grade level. For the Course class,
      you might need to keep track of the course name and the teacher’s name.
      What other attributes did you and your classmates come up with?

  <subsection xml:id="uml-class-diagrams">
    <title>UML Class Diagrams</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes it’s useful, when designing a complex system with lots of
      classes, to make diagrams of the classes that show you at a glance what
      instance variables and methods they have. Often these can just be sketches
      in your notebook or on a whiteboard but there are also more formal systems
      such as the <term>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</term> for drawing these
      diagrams.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, here is a UML class diagram for the <c>Turtle</c> class which
      includes a list of its attributes and behaviors. <term>Class
      Diagrams</term> are a way to represent the classes in a program and the
      data and procedural abstractions found in each class. T The attributes are
      the instance variables and the methods are the behaviors of the class.
      (The <c>-</c> in front of the attributes indicate that they are private,
      and the <c>+</c> in front of the methods indicate that they are public.
      We’ll learn about these more later on). Here is a <url

  <subsection xml:id="abstraction">
    <title>Abstraction</title>
    <p>
      <term>Abstraction</term> is the process of reducing complexity by focusing
      on the main idea. By hiding details irrelevant to the question at hand and
      bringing together related and useful details, abstraction reduces
      complexity and allows one to focus on the idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      The class diagram above is an example of abstraction. It shows the main
      idea of the Turtle class without showing all the details of the class. The
      diagram shows the attributes and methods of the class, but it does not
      show the details of how the methods are implemented.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="data-abstraction">
    <title>Data Abstraction</title>
    <p>
      <term>Data abstraction</term> provides a separation between the abstract
      properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.
      For example, we can use the <c>Turtle</c> class and type without needed to
      know how it is implemented. Data abstraction manages complexity by giving
      data a name without referencing the specific details of the
      representation. Data can take the form of a single variable or a
      collection of data, such as in a class like <c>Turtle</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      An <term>attribute</term> is a type of data abstraction that is defined in
      a class, for example the width or height of a Turtle object. An
      <term>instance variable</term> is an attribute whose value is unique to
      each instance of the class. For example, each turtle object could have
      different width or height values. A <term>class variable</term> is an
      attribute shared by all instances of the class. For example, we could keep
      a count of how many turtles have been created in a class variable. We will
      see more examples of these in the next lesson.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="procedural-abstraction">
    <title>Procedural Abstraction</title>
    <p>
      <term>Procedural abstraction</term> provides a name for a process and
      allows a method to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it.
      Through <term>method decomposition</term>, a programmer breaks down larger
      behaviors of the class into smaller behaviors by creating methods to
      represent each individual smaller behavior. For example, in the Turtle
      class, the <c>forward()</c> method is a procedural abstraction that allows
      the turtle to move forward without needing to know exactly how the turtle
      is animated to move forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some of the main reasons to use procedural abstraction and
      multiple methods in your programs:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Organization and Reducing Complexity: organize your program into
            small sections of code by function to reduce its complexity. Divide
            a problem into subproblems to solve it a piece at a time.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Reusing Code: avoid repetition of code. Reuse code by putting it in
            a method and calling it whenever needed.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Maintainability and Debugging: smaller methods are easier to debug
            and understand than searching through a large main method.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using procedural abstraction in a program allows programmers to change the
      internals of a method (to make it faster, more efficient, use less
      storage, etc.) without needing to notify method users of the change as
      long as the method signature and what the method does is preserved. For
      example, we could change the way the Turtle class is implemented to make
      it faster without needing to change the way the <c>forward()</c> method is
      called.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another reason to use procedural abstraction is to avoid repetition of
      code. For example, when we were deconstructing songs into methods in Unit
      1, we found that we could reuse the <c>chorus()</c> or <c>verse()</c>
      method for each verse of the song. A procedural abstraction may extract
      shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code.
      This allows for code reuse, which helps manage complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding parameters to methods allows for even more abstraction and
      flexibility in code. Parameters allow procedures to be generalized,
      enabling the procedures to be reused with a range of input values or
      arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a review, let’s deconstruct the song “Old MacDonald” into methods with
      parameters to avoid repetition of code, as in Unit 1.
    </p>

    <activity label="OldMacDonaldSongRepeated">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Complete the methods <c>chorus()</c> and <c>verse()</c>. Add method
          calls in main.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
        <code>
public class OldMacDonaldSong
{
    public static void intro()
    {
        System.out.println("Old MacDonald had a farm");
        chorus();
    }

    /* Complete the following method to print E-I-E-I-O */
    public static void chorus()
    {

    }

    /* Complete the following method to print the verse for the given animal and sound.
       For example, for a cow and moo, it should print out
       "And on this farm, they had a cow. E-I-E-I-O
       With a moo moo here and a moo moo there,
       here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo".
       Make sure to use the variables animal and sound and the method chorus()!
    */
    public static void verse(String animal, String sound)
    {

    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        intro();
        verse("cow","moo");
        intro();
        // TODO:
        // Call verse again with duck and quack
        //   and then call intro again


        // Call verse again with another animal and sound
        //  and then call intro again


     }

    <title>Group Challenge : Game Design</title>
    <p>
      Working in groups, let’s explore making a computer game that is an
      adaptation of a board game that you know. Think about what objects are in
      the game. For example, here is the description for Monopoly (trademark
      Hasbro games):
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            “Buy, sell, dream and scheme your way to riches. Players buy, sell
            and trade to win. Build houses and hotels on your properties and
            bankrupt your opponents to win it all. Chance and Community Chest
            cards can change everything.”
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      What classes would you need to create a computer version of this game?
      (Remember to look for the nouns). Take one of the classes you listed, and
      try to come up with 2 pieces of data in that class that will be the
      instance variables. Then, come up with 2 methods (look for verbs) for the
      class that use the data in the instance variables. Write your answers
      below.
