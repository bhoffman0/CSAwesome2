  <title>Methods: Passing and Returning References of an Object</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Programs often consist of many classes that interact with each other.
      Objects of one class can be instance variables of another class. Objects
      can be passed as arguments to methods and returned from methods. This is a
      powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows for complex
      interactions between objects.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="objects-as-instance-variables">
    <title>Objects as Instance Variables</title>
    <p>
      Classes can have complex instance variables that use other classes. For
      example, a <c>Person</c> class could have an instance variable for the
      address which can be an object with its own instance variables of street,
      city, state, and zipcode. This is a <term>has-a</term> relationship where
      a Person <title_reference>has an</title_reference> Address inside it.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
class Address
{
    // instance variables
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipcode;
}

class Person
{
    // instance variables
    private String name;
    private Address addr;  // instance variable of type Address
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      In Java, usually each class is saved in its own file with the same name as
      the class, so the Person class would be in Person.java and the Address
      class would be in Address.java. If the files are in the same folder, they
      can be compiled together so that they can interact. In Runestone, we
      cannot have separate files, so we put them in 1 coding area. In Runestone,
      only the class that has the main method can be public; the other classes
      can leave out the public keyword.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="objects-as-arguments">
    <title>Objects as Arguments</title>
    <p>
      Java uses <term>Call by Value</term> when it passes arguments to methods
      and constructors. This means that a copy of the value in the argument is
      saved in the parameter variable. If the parameter variable changes its
      value inside the method, the original value outside the method is not
      changed. With primitive types like int and double, the argument value is
      copied into the parameter variable as expected. However, if you pass in an
      argument that holds a reference to an object, like a String or Person or
      Address or Turtle objects, the reference is copied, not the whole object.
      Java was designed this way to avoid copying large objects from method to
      method.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a copy of a reference is passed in and saved in the parameter
      variable, the parameter and the argument are then <term>aliases</term>,
      both refering to the same object. Remember when we discussed reference
      aliases with turtle objects in <xref ref="topic-2-2-booleans"/>. An object 
      can have many names or aliases that refer to it, much like you may call
      your teacher with their last name, but friends may call them by their first name, 
      and their children may call them Mom or Dad.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Turtle Reference Equality</caption>
      <image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/turtleEquality.png" width="89%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      When we pass an object to a method, the parameter variable holds a
      reference to the same object as the argument variable. This is similar
      to a Google doc where multiple people can edit the same document at the
      same time (Thanks to Rachel Chagnon at Somerville High School, MA for this analogy). 
      If one person changes the document, everyone else sees the change. 
      In the same way, if a method changes the state of a mutable object
      that was passed in as a parameter, the change is seen by the caller of
      the method. This can lead to unexpected results if we want to preserve 
      the original object unchanged. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Some classes like <c>String</c> are immutable, so they cannot be changed 
      by any method; for example, when <c>s.toUpperCase()</c> is called, 
      it returns a new String object with the
      uppercase letters, but the original String object is not changed. Any new
      classes that you write that have setters or methods that change the state
      of the object will be mutable. So, if you pass in an object of a class
      that you write into a method as an argument, you need to be careful that
      the method does not change the object unless that is the intended
      behavior. It is good programming practice to not modify mutable objects
      that are passed as parameters unless required in the specification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Try the code below. Add code in the main method that changes the original
      address to your city. Does it also change in the person object? This can
      be a problem with references to mutable objects. In the next subsection,
      we’ll copy the Address object to avoid this problem.
    </p>

    <activity label="AddressPerson">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Try the following code. Scroll down to see both the Person and the
          Address class definitions. The Person class has an Address object as
          an instance variable. Add code in the main method that changes the
          original address to your city. Does it also change in the person
          object? This can be a problem with references to mutable objects.

    <title>Copying Parameter Objects</title>
    <p>
      The <c>Person</c> class above has an <c>Address</c> object as an instance
      variable. We found that changing the Address object outside the class also
      changed the address in the Person object. This is because the Address
      object is mutable, and the reference to the object is passed in as an
      argument to the constructor.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you pass object references as parameters to constructors, those
      references refer to the same objects as the references in the caller. If
      the objects are immutable, like <c>String</c> objects it doesn’t matter at
      all. On the other hand, if the objects are <term>mutable</term>, meaning
      their instance variables can change after they are constructed, then
      storing the passed-in reference in an instance variable in your object can
      lead to surprising results: if some other code changes the object it will
      change for you too. If that’s not what you want, sometimes it makes sense
      to copy the object passed to the constructor and store the copy in the
      instance variable instead. How to make the copy will depend on the class
      of the object, but often you can just construct a new object of the
      appropriate class using values from the original object as shown below.
      This way the instance variable <c>addr</c> does not hold a reference to
      the original object <c>initAddr</c>, and the methods in the <c>Person</c>
      class cannot modify the state of the original object.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class Person
{
    private String name;
    private Address addr; // Assumes an Address class is already defined

    // constructor: initialize instance variable and call Address constructor to
    // make a copy
    public Person(String initName, Address initAddr)
    {
        name = initName;
        addr =  new Address(
                        initAddr.getStreet(),
                        initAddr.getCity(),
                        initAddr.getState(),
                        initAddr.getZipcode());
   }
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Another way to handle this is to provide a copy constructor in the
      <c>Address</c> class that takes an <c>Address</c> object as a parameter
      and makes a copy of it. Then, the <c>Person</c> constructor can call the
      <c>Address</c> copy constructor.

        state = initState;
        zipcode = initZipcode;
    }
    // copy constructor
    public Address(Address otherAddr)
    {
        street = otherAddr.getStreet();
        city = otherAddr.getCity();

    <title>Returning Objects</title>
    <p>
      Methods can also return objects. Remember that methods can only return the
      value of a variable. If the return value is of a primitive type like int
      or double, only a copy of the value is returned; the original variable
      cannot be changed. But when the return expression evaluates to an object
      reference, the reference is returned, not a reference to a new copy of the
      object. This means that there can be multiple references to the same
      object. If the object is mutable, then any changes made to the object
      through one reference will be seen through any other references to the
      object.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the <c>Person</c> class can have a <c>getAddress</c> method
      that returns the <c>Address</c> instance variable which is an object.
      Since <c>Address</c> has set methods which make it mutable, the caller can
      change the Address object through the reference returned by the method.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class Person
{
    // instance variables
    private String name;
    private Address addr;  // instance variable of type Address

    public Address getAddress()
    {
        return addr;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Person p1 = new Person("Skyler", 
                          new Address("123 Main St", 
                              "Anytown","Anystate","12345"));
        System.out.println(p1);
        Address a = p1.getAddress();
        a.setCity("Othertown");
        System.out.println(p1);
    }
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Notice that we created the new Address object above inside the call to the
      <c>Person</c> constructor, instead of saving it into a variable first:
      <c>Person p1 = new Person("Skyler", new Address("123 Main St",
      "Anytown","Anystate","12345"))</c>. This is called an <term>anonymous
      object</term> where we create a new object without associating it with a
      variable. This is useful when you only need the object for a short time.
      This new Address object will be copied into the instance variable
      <c>addr</c> in the <c>Person</c> constructor.
    </p>

    <p>Try it in the code below.</p>
    <activity label="PersonReturnAddress">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Run the code to see that the Person class can return the Address
          object which is mutable. Add code in the main method that changes the
          zipcode of the Address object returned by the getAddress method. It
          will change the zipcode in the Person object too.

    <title>Chaining Method Calls</title>
    <p>
      Programmers will sometimes call methods in a chain, one after another on
      the same line, for example <c>p.getAddress().getCity()</c>. The method
      calls are separated by a dot and the return value of each method is used
      as the object for the next method call. It is important to know the types
      that each method returns so that you can call the methods of that object.
      For example, if the first method returns a String, the next method must be
      one that is defined for a String object. In the code below, the
      <c>getAddress</c> method returns an Address object, and then the
      <c>getCity</c> method is called on that Address object.

            (AP 3.4.A.3) When a mutable object is a constructor parameter, the

            referenced object. In this way, the instance variable does not hold
            a reference to the original object, and methods are prevented from
            modifying the state of the original object.

            (AP 3.6.A.1) When an argument is an object reference, the parameter
            is initialized with a copy of that reference; it does not create a
            new independent copy of the object. If the parameter refers to a
            mutable object, the method or constructor can use this reference to
            alter the state of the object. It is good programming practice to
            not modify mutable objects that are passed as parameters unless
            required in the specification.

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 3.6.A.2) When the return expression evaluates to an object
            reference, the reference is returned, not a reference to a new copy
            of the object.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 3.6.A.3) Methods cannot access the private data and methods of a
            parameter that holds a reference to an object unless the parameter
            is the same type as the method’s enclosing class.
