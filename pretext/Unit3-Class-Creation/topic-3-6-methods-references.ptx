  <title>Methods: Passing and Returning References of an Object</title><introduction>
    
    <p>Programs often consist of many classes that interact with each other. Objects of one class can be instance variables of another class. Objects can be passed as arguments to methods and returned from methods. This is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows for complex interactions between objects.</p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
            <title>Objects as Instance Variables</title>
            <p>Classes can have complex instance variables that use other classes. For example, a <c>Person</c> class could have an instance variable for the address which can be an object with its own instance variables of street, city, state, and zipcode. This is a <term>has-a</term> relationship where a Person <title_reference>has an</title_reference> Address inside it.</p>
            <program language="java"><code>
class Address
{
    // instance variables
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zipcode;
}

class Person
{
    // instance variables
    private String name;
    private Address addr;  // instance variable of type Address
}
</code></program>
            <p>In Java, usually each class is saved in its own file with the same name as the class, so the Person class would be in Person.java and the Address class would be in Address.java. If the files are in the same folder, they can be compiled together so that they can interact. In Runestone, we cannot have separate files, so we put them in 1 coding area. In Runestone, only the class that has the main method can be public; the other classes can leave out the public keyword.</p>
        </subsection>
  <subsection>
            <title>Objects as Arguments</title>
            <p>Java uses <term>Call by Value</term> when it passes arguments to methods and constructors. This means that a copy of the value in the argument is saved in the parameter variable. If the parameter variable changes its value inside the method, the original value outside the method is not changed. With primitive types like int and double, the argument value is copied into the parameter variable as expected. However, if you pass in an argument that holds a reference to an object, like a String or Person or Address or Turtle objects, the reference is copied, not the whole object. Java was designed this way to avoid copying large objects from method to method.</p>
            <p>When a copy of a reference is passed in and saved in the parameter variable, the parameter and the argument are then <term>aliases</term>, both refering to the same object. Remember when we discussed reference aliases with turtle objects who are set equal to one another.</p>
            <figure align="center"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Turtle Reference Equality</caption><image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/turtleEquality.png" width="89%"/></figure>
            <p>There can be unexpected results if the parameter refers to a mutable object; the method or constructor can use this reference to alter the state of the original object. Some classes like <c>String</c> are immutable, so they cannot be changed by any method; for example, when <c>s.toUpperCase()</c> is called, it returns a new String object with the uppercase letters, but the original String object is not changed. Any new classes that you write that have setters or methods that change the state of the object will be mutable. So, if you pass in an object of a class that you write into a method as an argument, you need to be careful that the method does not change the object unless that is the intended behavior. It is good programming practice to not modify mutable objects that are passed as parameters unless required in the specification.</p>
            <p>Try the code below. Add code in the main method that changes the original address to your city. Does it also change in the person object? This can be a problem with references to mutable objects. In the next subsection, we’ll copy the Address object to avoid this problem.</p>

            <p>Try the following code. Scroll down to see both the Person and the Address class definitions. The Person class has an Address object as an instance variable.

            <title>Copying Parameter Objects</title>
            <p>The <c>Person</c> class above has an <c>Address</c> object as an instance variable. We found that changing the Address object outside the class also changed the address in the Person object. This is because the Address object is mutable, and the reference to the object is passed in as an argument to the constructor.</p>
            <p>When you pass object references as parameters to
                constructors, those references refer to the same objects as the
                references in the caller. If the objects are immutable, like <c>String</c> objects
                it doesn’t matter at all. On the other hand, if the objects are <term>mutable</term>,
                meaning their instance variables can change after they are constructed, then
                storing the passed-in reference in an instance variable in your object can lead
                to surprising results: if some other code changes the object it will change for
                you too. If that’s not what you want, sometimes it makes sense to copy the
                object passed to the constructor and store the copy in the instance variable
                instead. How to make the copy will depend on the class of the object, but often
                you can just construct a new object of the appropriate class using values from
                the original object as shown below. This way the instance variable <c>addr</c> does not hold a reference to the original object <c>initAddr</c>, and the methods in the <c>Person</c> class cannot modify the state of the original object.</p>
            <program language="java"><code>
public class Person
{
    private String name;
    private Address addr; // Assumes an Address class is already defined

    // constructor: initialize instance variable and call Address constructor to
    // make a copy
    public Person(String initName, Address initAddr)
    {
        name = initName;
        addr =  new Address(
                        initAddr.getStreet(),
                        initAddr.getCity(),
                        initAddr.getState(),
                        initAddr.getZipcode());
   }
}
</code></program>
            <p>Another way to handle this is to provide a copy constructor in the <c>Address</c> class that takes an <c>Address</c> object as a parameter and makes a copy of it. Then, the <c>Person</c> constructor can call the <c>Address</c> copy constructor.</p>
            <program language="java"><code>

    private String city;

                   String initState, String initZipcode)

        city = initCity;
        state = initState;
        zipcode = initZipcode;
    }

        street = otherAddr.getStreet();

            <title>Returning Objects</title>
            <p>Methods can also return objects. Remember that methods can only return the value of a variable. If the return value is of a primitive type like int or double, only a copy of the value is returned; the original variable cannot be changed. But when the return expression evaluates to an object reference, the reference is returned, not a reference to a new copy of the object. This means that there can be multiple references to the same object. If the object is mutable, then any changes made to the object through one reference will be seen through any other references to the object.</p>
            <p>For example, the <c>Person</c> class can have a <c>getAddress</c> method that returns the <c>Address</c> instance variable which is an object. Since <c>Address</c> has set methods which make it mutable, the caller can change the Address object through the reference returned by the method.</p>

            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 3.4.A.3) When a mutable object is a constructor parameter, the instance variable should be initialized with a copy of the referenced object. In this way, the instance variable does not hold a reference to the original object, and methods are prevented from modifying the state of the original object.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 3.6.A.1) When an argument is an object reference, the parameter is initialized with a copy of that reference; it does not create a new independent copy of the object. If the parameter refers to a mutable object, the method or constructor can use this reference to alter the state of the object. It is good programming practice to not modify mutable objects that are passed as parameters unless required in the specification.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 3.6.A.2) When the return expression evaluates to an object reference, the reference is returned, not a reference to a new copy of the object.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 3.6.A.3) Methods cannot access the private data and methods of a parameter that holds a reference to an object unless the parameter is the same type as the method’s enclosing class.</p>
                </li>
