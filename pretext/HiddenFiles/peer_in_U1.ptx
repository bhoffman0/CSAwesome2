          <p>
            Incorrect! The first print statement outputs whether the x value
            equals 3 or not. Remember, == checks for equality and = sets a
            variable to a value.

            Correct! The first print statment outputs whether the x value equals
            to 3 and the second statement prints out z, the sum of x and y.

        <feedback>
          <p>
            Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not deep red. Red is (255,
            0, 0) in RGB so 11111111 00000000 00000000 represents red in binary.

            Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not white. White is
            typically interpreted as 1 in bits. Since white is (255, 255, 255)
            in RGB, it would be 11111111 11111111 11111111 in binary.
