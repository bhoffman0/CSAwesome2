int x = 3;
int y = 2;
System.out.println(x == 3);

                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! The first print statement outputs whether the x value equals 3 or not. Remember, == checks for equality and = sets a variable to a value.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Correct! The first print statment outputs whether the x value equals to 3 and the second statement prints out z, the sum of x and y.</p>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not deep red. Red is (255, 0, 0) in RGB so 11111111 00000000 00000000 represents red in binary.</p>

                    <p>Incorrect! 11111111 means 255 in binary, not white. White is typically interpreted as 1 in bits. Since white is (255, 255, 255) in RGB, it would be 11111111 11111111 11111111 in binary.</p>
