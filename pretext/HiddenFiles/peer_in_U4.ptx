        <statement>

        <p> Which statement best describes what this code does?</p>
        <program language="java"><code>
Pixel[] pixelArray = this.getPixels();

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>Decreases the blue component of a picture</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! The blue component of the picture is not necessarily decreased in the for each loop. The for each loop loops through the Pixel objects in pixelArray, calls getGreen, stores getGreen into value, and then sets value into blue.</p>

            <choice>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! The green component is not altered. The for each loop loops through the Pixel objects in pixelArray, calls getGreen, stores getGreen into value, and then sets value into blue.</p>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! Although it is possible that the code is performing this action, it is more accurate that the for each loop loops through the Pixel objects in pixelArray, calls getGreen, stores getGreen into value, and then sets value into blue.</p>
                </feedback>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Correct! The for each loop loops through the Pixel objects in pixelArray, calls getGreen, stores getGreen into value, and then sets value into blue.</p>
