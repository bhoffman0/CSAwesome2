            Incorrect! The larger highlighted section (1) represents the array
            Pixel[ ] which is composed of the smaller highlighted section (2),
            Pixel objects. Pixel[ ] cannot be composed of Color objects and a
            Pixel object is not an array so it cannot contain other objects.
