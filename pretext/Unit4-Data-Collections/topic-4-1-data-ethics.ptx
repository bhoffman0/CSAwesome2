    <title>Data Privacy</title>
    <p>
      Your phone keeps a lot of information about you, including where you have
      been, what you buy, what games you play, etc. Here’s a <url
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqWuioPHhz0"
      visual="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqWuioPHhz0">video</url> about the
      massive amounts of data our smart phones and computers collect about us.
      If you have used your phone to give you directions to go somewhere, it
      probably tracks your location. If you take a photo, you may not realize
      that the photo has metadata that includes the location where the photo was  
      taken unless you turned that off in your phone settings. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Follow the directions in <url
      href="https://www.lifewire.com/location-history-google-maps-iphone-1683392"
      visual="https://www.lifewire.com/location-history-google-maps-iphone-1683392">https://www.lifewire.com/location-history-google-maps-iphone-1683392</url>
      to see if you have location history settings on. In iPhones, you can adjust camera 
      location settings under Settings/Privacy&amp;Security/Location Services/Camera. 
      You can also turn off location tracking completely, but it is useful when you want 
      directions and it’s free. Do the benefits of apps that provide driving directions outweigh 
      the lack of privacy for you? In what situations would it be beneficial or
      harmful for the app to track your location?

      As users, we often don’t realize how much personal data we are giving
      away. If you use a computer or phone, your personal privacy is at risk. As
      computer programmers, we must be aware of the risks to data privacy when
      our code collects and stores personal data on computer systems.
      Programmers should attempt to safeguard the personal privacy of the user.
      Legally and ethically, we must ask the users for permission to access and
      store their data. And if there are data breaches where the data is stolen,
      we must inform the affected users. The laws are slowly catching up to our
      technology, and many countries and states are passing laws to protect data
      privacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computer use and programs have beneficial and/or harmful impacts on
      personal security. Software apps for maps and driving directions are very
      useful, but they have impacts on personal security and privacy if they
      keep track of your location. This information could be beneficial, for
      example if you are lost and need to be found, but could be harmful and
      unsafe if someone unauthorized gains access to your location.

    <title>Data and Bias</title>
    <p>
      The fields of <term>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</term> and <term>Machine
      Learning (ML)</term> are rapidly growing and increasingly involve ethical
      questions about data collection, privacy, and resource use. Machine
      learning algorithms to create software like ChatGPT require massive
      amounts of data to learn from as well as massive amounts of energy use.
      But where does this data come from? Often the data is collected from the
      internet, and the internet is full of biases. For example, if you search
      for professions like “programmer”, “doctor”, “CEO” in <url
      href="https://images.google.com/"
      visual="https://images.google.com/">https://images.google.com/</url>, you
      will probably see mostly images of white men. This reflects a bias in our
      world that AIs may learn. An AI could then generate text or images that
      are biased against historically underrepresented groups. For example, a
      prominent tech company in 2014 started building an automated hiring tool,
      a resume filtering AI trained on their current employees resumes, and
      ended up with an AI system that was biased against women (<url
      href="https://www.aclu.org/news/womens-rights/why-amazons-automated-hiring-tool-discriminated-against"
      visual="https://www.aclu.org/news/womens-rights/why-amazons-automated-hiring-tool-discriminated-against">https://www.aclu.org/news/womens-rights/why-amazons-automated-hiring-tool-discriminated-against</url>).
      This is a problem because the AI is learning from biased data and then
      creating biased outcomes that could affect people’s lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Algorithmic bias</term> describes systemic and repeated errors in a
      program that create unfair outcomes for a specific group of users. Bias in
      data can lead to unfair and unethical outcomes. For instance, facial
      recognition software has been shown to have higher error rates for people
      with darker skin tones. This is because the data used to train these
      algorithms often contains fewer examples of people with darker skin tones.
      As a result, the software is less accurate for these individuals, which
      can lead to discriminatory practices.

    <p>
      Programmers should be aware of the data set collection method and the
      potential for bias before using the data to extrapolate new information or
      drawing conclusions. Some data sets are incomplete or contain inaccurate
      data. Using such data in the development or use of a program can cause the
      program to work incorrectly or inefficiently. Or the contents of a data
      set might be related to a specific question or topic and might not be
      appropriate to give correct answers or extrapolate information for a
      different question or topic.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important for programmers and data scientists to take steps to
      mitigate bias in data collection and use. This can include using diverse
      and representative datasets, regularly testing algorithms for bias, and
      being transparent about the limitations of the software. Here are some
      steps that can be taken to address bias in machine learning:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use diverse and representative data sets to train algorithms.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Regularly test algorithms for bias and accuracy.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Be transparent about the limitations and potential biases of the
            software.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Involve diverse teams in the development and testing of algorithms.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Implement ethical guidelines and standards for the use of AI and
            machine learning.
