  <title>Data Sets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A <term>data set</term> is a collection of specific pieces of information
      or data. For example, the following table is a data set that keeps track
      of information about students. Data can be represented in a diagram by
      using a chart or table. Here it is shown as a spreadsheet table with
      columns for the first name, last name, email, and GPA. Spreadsheet
      software like Excel and Google Sheets store data in a table and provide
      functions to manipulate and calculate with the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data sets can be manipulated and analyzed to solve a problem or answer a
      question. Data in a table or chart can be used to plan the algorithm that
      will be used to manipulate the data. For example, how would you find the
      average GPA of the students in the table above? You would need to access
      each GPA value in the table and then add them up and then divide by the
      number of rows.
    </p>

    <p>
      When analyzing data sets, values within the set are accessed and utilized
      one at a time and then processed according to the desired outcome. Loops
      can be used to access and process each value in a data set. Letâ€™s practice
      this with pseudocode.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if your school wants to print out an honor roll of students with a
      GPA of 3.5 or higher? How would you write an algorithm to do this?
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next lessons, we will learn about data structures like Java arrays
      that can be used to store data sets. We will use loops to access and
      manipulate the data in the arrays.

        Write pseudocode for an algorithm that prints out the names of students
        with a GPA of 3.5 or higher given a table of student data where one
        column is the GPA. Make sure you use repetition (loop) and selection
        (if) in your algorithm.
