      The following is part b of a free response question from 2014. It was
      question 1 on the exam. You can see all the free response questions from
      past exams at <url href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-

    <p>
      <term>Question 1.</term> This question involves reasoning about strings
      made up of uppercase letters. You will implement two related methods that
      appear in the same class (not shown). The first method takes a single
      string parameter and returns a scrambled version of that string. The
      second method takes a list of strings and modifies the list by scrambling
      each entry in the list. Any entry that cannot be scrambled is removed from
      the list.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Part b.</term> Write the method <c>scrambleOrRemove</c>, which
      replaces each word in the parameter <c>wordList</c> with its scrambled
      version and removes any words that are unchanged after scrambling. The
      relative order of the words in <c>wordList</c> remains the same as before
      the call to <c>scrambleOrRemove</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following example shows how the contents of <c>wordList</c> would be
      modified as a result of calling <c>scrambleOrRemove</c>.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Example call and result</caption>
      <image source="Unit4-Data-Collections/Figures/stringScrambleB.png" width="89%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Assume that the method <c>scrambleWord</c> works as intended and is in the
      same class. It will return the scrambled word or the same word. You will
      write the <c>scrambleOrRemove</c> method to replace each original word
      with the scrambled word or remove the word if it was not scrambled.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
import java.util.List;

public class ScrambledStrings
{

    /**
     * Modifies wordList by replacing each word with its scrambled version,
     * removing any words that are unchanged as a result of scrambling.
     *
     * @param wordList the list of words Precondition: wordList contains only
     *     non-null objects Postcondition: - all words unchanged by scrambling have
     *     been removed from wordList - each of the remaining words has been
     *     replaced by its scrambled version - the relative ordering of the entries
     *     in wordList is the same as it was before the method was called
     */
    public static void scrambleOrRemove(List&lt;String&gt; wordList)
    {
        /* to be implemented in part b */
    }

      This section contains a plain English explanation of one way to solve this
      problem as well as problems that test your understanding of how to write
      the code to do those things.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example the first word (at index 0) <c>TAN</c> is scrambled and
      replaced. The second word <c>ABRACADABRA</c> (at index 1) is scrambled and
      replaced. The third word <c>WHOA</c> (at index 2) is removed. The fourth
      word <c>APPLE</c> (at index 3) is scrambled and replaced. The fifth word
      <c>EGGS</c> (at index 4) is removed since the scrambled word is the same
      as the original. What method of List allows you to replace an element in a
      list? What method of list allows you to remove an element from a list? How
      can you loop through a list and not always increment the current index?

      Loop through the list and scramble the current word. If the scrambled word
      and original are equal then remove the word from the list and otherwise
      replace it. We will have to be careful since the size of the list can
      change in the loop. If we remove an element all the other elements will
      shift left. We will only want to increment the index if the word was
      replaced and not removed. There are many ways to solve this problem but we
      have outlined 2 in the following optional questions. If you feel that you
      are ready to solve the problem, please skip ahead to the active code
