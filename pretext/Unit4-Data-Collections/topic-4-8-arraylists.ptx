    <p>
      At the beginning of this unit, we learned about using arrays to hold
      collections of related data. However arrays are not very flexible. Most
      notably, the size of an array is established at the time of creation and
      cannot be changed. What if you don’t know how big the collection of data
      will be? What if you want to both add and remove items from a collection?
      For example, if you wanted to represent a shopping list, you might add to
      the list throughout the week and remove things from the list while you are
      shopping. You probably would not know how many items will be on the list
      at the beginning of the week.
    </p>

    <p>
      For cases like this, Java has a class called <c>ArrayList</c> which is a
      re-sizable list. It is called <c>ArrayList</c> because it stores the items
      that have been added to it in an underlying array. But it also takes care
      of keeping track of how many items have been added to the array and it
      will create a new bigger array under the covers when needed to hold more
      items.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use <c>ArrayList</c> instead of arrays whenever you don’t know the
      size of the array you need or you know that you will add and remove items
      and may need to change the array’s size dynamically during run time. An
      <c>ArrayList</c> is <term>mutable</term> in size and contains object
      references, meaning it can change during run time by adding and removing
      objects from it.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        An <c>ArrayList</c> is often called just a list. Prior to 2020 the AP
        CSA curriculum included <term>interfaces</term> which are somewhat like
        classes and the interface <c>List</c> was often used to declare a
        variable that would refer to an <c>ArrayList</c>. Interfaces are no
        longer on the exam, but if you see <c>List</c> being used in an old exam
        question just assume it’s an <c>ArrayList</c>.

            No, An ArrayList grows as needed and is typically bigger than the
            data put into it. If the underlying array in an ArrayList is full
            when adding in new data, it usually doubles in size.

            No, an ArrayList is implemented using an array so it has the same

    <title>import java.util.ArrayList</title>
    <idx>import</idx>
    <idx>java.util</idx>
    <p>
      The <c>ArrayList</c> class is in the <c>java.util</c> package. A
      <term>package</term> is a set or library of related classes. The classes
      we have used until now, such as <c>String</c> and <c>Math</c>, are in the
      special package <c>java.lang</c> whose classes are always available in any
      Java program. Other packages, such as <c>java.util</c>, provide classes
      that can only be used either by <term>importing</term> them or (much more
      rarely) by referring to them by their full name which includes the package
      as a prefix. The full name of <c>ArrayList</c> is thus
      <c>java.util.ArrayList</c> but rather than type that out all the time, in
      any class where we want to use <c>ArrayList</c> we will usually import it
      with an <c>import</c> statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Import statements have to come before the class definition in a Java
      source file and serve to tell Java which class you mean when you use a
      short name like <c>ArrayList</c>. To import just one class we use a single
      <c>import</c> of the fully-qualified name of the class like this:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// Import just the ArrayList class from java.util
import java.util.ArrayList;
      </code>
    </program>

    <idx>package</idx>
    <idx>
      <h>statement</h><h>import</h>
    </idx>

    <p>
      After such an import statement, anywhere <c>ArrayList</c> is used as a
      class name in the file it will be taken to mean
      <c>java.util.ArrayList</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another option is to import all the classes in a package with a “wildcard”
      import:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// Import everything in java.util including ArrayList
import java.util.*;
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      This import statement will also cause, <c>ArrayList</c> to refer
      <c>java.util.ArrayList</c>. But many other names of classes defined in the
      <c>java.util</c> package will also be available whether you use them or
      not. (One that you have probably used by now is <c>Scanner</c> which can
      be used to read input a user types at the command line.) Using wildcard
      imports can cause conflicts if you import all the classes from two
      different packages and they have class names in common but usually that’s
      not a problem, at least with packages that are part of Java itself.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Don’t worry about adding import statements on the AP CSA exam. Any that
        you need will be provided for you.

  <subsection xml:id="declaring-and-creating-arraylists">
    <title>Declaring and Creating ArrayLists</title>
    <p>
      To declare an ArrayList use <c>ArrayList&lt;Type&gt; name</c> where
      <em>Type</em>, called a <term>type parameter</term> is the type of objects
      you want to store in the ArrayList. For example a variable naming an
      <c>ArrayList</c> meant to hold <c>String</c>s is declared as
      <c>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</c> as shown in the code below. Programmers use
      the letter E and call it the <term>generic type</term> for an Element.
      <c>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</c>, where the generic type <c>E</c> specifies the
      type of the elements. (Without it, the type will be <c>Object</c>). When
      <c>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</c> is specified, the types of the reference
      parameters and return type when using its methods are type <c>E</c>.
      <c>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</c>, where the generic type <c>E</c> specifies the
      type of the elements. So if E is <c>String</c>, then the type of the
      reference parameters and return type when using its methods are type
      <c>String</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can declare a variable to just be of type <c>ArrayList</c>, with no
      type parameter, and it’ll be approximately the same as if you had declared
      <c>ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;</c>, but it is good practice to specify the
      type of objects you intend to store in an <c>ArrayList</c> as it allows
      the compiler to find errors (that are specific to that to Strings or ints
      or whatever type you put in) that would otherwise be missed until run
      time.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// ArrayList&lt;Type&gt; name = new ArrayList&lt;Type&gt;();
// An ArrayList of Strings:
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; shoppingList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      As with other reference types, declaring a <c>ArrayList</c> variable
      doesn’t actually create a <c>ArrayList</c> object. It only creates a
      variable that can refer to a <c>ArrayList</c> or <c>null</c>. To actually
      create a <c>ArrayList</c> we must invoke a constructor such as <c>new
      ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()</c>. The <c>ArrayList</c> constructor
      <c>ArrayList()</c> constructs an empty list.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can get the number of items in a <c>ArrayList</c> using the
      <c>size()</c> method. Notice that a newly constructed <c>ArrayList</c> is
      empty and thus has a size of 0. Also remember that you can’t call methods
      on <c>null</c> so trying to call <c>size</c> on the value of <c>list2</c>
      at line 10 below causes a <c>NullPointerException</c>.
    </p>

      <statement>

          The following code demonstrates a NullPointerException. Change the
          list2 declaration so that it creates a new ArrayList to remove the
          NullPointerException.

    <p>
      You can also create ArrayLists of integer and double values. However, you
      have to use the wrapper classes <c>Integer</c> or <c>Double</c> as the
      type parameter because <c>ArrayList</c>s can only hold objects, not
      primitive values. All primitive types must be <term>wrapped</term> in
      objects before they are added to an ArrayList. For example, <c>int</c>
      values can be wrapped in <c>Integer</c> objects, <c>double</c> values can
      be wrapped in <c>Double</c> objects. However this normally happens
      automatically thanks to autoboxing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can actually put in any kind of objects in an <c>ArrayList</c>,
      including instances of classes that you write, such as the <c>Student</c>,
      <c>Person</c>, or <c>Pet</c> classes.

    <p>
      You can get the number of items in a <c>ArrayList</c> using its
      <c>size()</c> method. The <c>ArrayList</c> starts out empty with a size of
      0.

ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
System.out.println( list.size() );
      </code>
    </program>

    <note>
      <p>
        With arrays, you use the <c>length</c> field to get the number of items
        in the array. But, with an <c>ArrayList</c> you use the <c>size()</c>
        method to get the number of items in the <c>ArrayList</c>. You will not
        be penalized if you mix up <c>length</c> and <c>size()</c> in the CSA
        exam. The number of items in an empty <c>ArrayList</c> is 0.

    <p>
      You can add values to an <c>ArrayList</c> using the method <c>add(obj)</c>
      which will add the object to the end of the list, just like you would join
      the end of the line to board a bus. Note that we can add objects of any

    <p>
      You can get the object at an index using <c>obj = listName.get(index)</c>
      and set the object at an index using <c>listName.set(index,obj)</c>. Both
      methods require that the index argument refer to an existing element of
      the list, i.e. the index must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than
      the <c>size()</c> of the list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that <c>ArrayList</c>s use <c>get</c> and <c>set</c> methods
      instead of the index operator that we use with arrays:
      <c>array[index]</c>. This is because <c>ArrayList</c> is a class with
      methods, not a built in type with special support in the language like
      arrays.

      Comparing arrays and <c>ArrayList</c>s
    </title>

    <p>
      When do you use arrays and when do you use <c>ArrayList</c>s? Use an array
      when you want to store several items of the same type and you know how
      many items will be in the array and the items in the array won’t change in
      order or number. Use an <c>ArrayList</c> when you want to store several
      items of the same type and you don’t know how many items you will need in
      the list or when you want to remove items from the list or add items to
      the list while the program is running.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a comparison of how to create arrays and <c>ArrayList</c>s:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// arrays must specify a size!
int[] highScores = new int[5];
String[] names = new String[5];

// ArrayLists are empty to start with
ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; highScoreList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; nameList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Here is a comparison of how to access and change elements in arrays and
      <c>ArrayList</c>s. Note that <c>ArrayList</c>s have a method <c>size()</c>
      instead of a <c>length</c> property, and <c>ArrayList</c>s use
      <c>get</c>/<c>set</c> methods instead of the index operator (<c>[]</c>).
    </p>

          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">ArrayList</cell>
        </row>

        <row left="minor">
          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">length/size</cell>
          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">array.length</cell>
          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">list.size()</cell>
        </row>

        <row left="minor">
          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">Access</cell>
          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">value = array[index];</cell>
          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">value = list.get(index);</cell>
        </row>

        <row left="minor">

          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">list.set(index,value);</cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note that the <c>ArrayList</c> methods <c>add</c> and <c>remove</c> do not
      have a simple equivalent in arrays because they change the number of
      elements in the list and may shift the positions of other elements.

      Although it is not on the AP exam, you can convert an array to a
      <c>List</c> using the static method <c>asList</c> from the <c>Arrays</c>
      helper class: <c>Arrays.asList(arrayname)</c>. Note that <c>ArrayList</c>
      has a <c>toString</c> method that is automatically called to print the
      list in a nice format.

    <title>Coding Challenge : FRQ Digits</title>
    <p>
      This coding challenge is based on the <url
      href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-frq-2017.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a"

      Free Response Question</url> part 1a on the 2017 AP CSA exam. In this
      question, you are asked to write a constructor for a class called
      <c>Digits</c>. This constructor takes an integer number as its argument
      and divides it up into its digits and puts the digits into an
      <c>ArrayList</c>. For example, <c>new Digits(154)</c> creates an ArrayList
      with the digits [1, 5, 4].
    </p>

    <p>
      First, let’s discuss how to break up a number into its digits. Try the
      code below. What happens if you divide an integer by 10? Remember that in
      integer division the result truncates (cuts off) everything to the right
      of the decimal point. Which digit can you get by using <c>% 10</c> which
      returns the remainder after dividing by 10? Try a different number and
      guess what it will print and then run to check.
    </p>

    <activity label="divideby10">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Set number to a different number and guess what number / and % will
          return. Which operator gives you a digit in number?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
        <code>
public class DivideBy10
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int number = 154;
        System.out.println(number / 10);
        System.out.println(number % 10);
    }
}
        </code>

public class RunestoneTests extends CodeTestHelper
{
    public RunestoneTests()
    {
        super("DivideBy10");
    }

    @Test
    public void test1()
    {
        String origCode =
                "public class DivideBy10{public static void main(String[] args){int number ="
                    + " 154;System.out.println(number / 10);System.out.println(number % 10);}}";

        boolean changed = codeChanged(origCode);

        assertTrue(changed);
    }
}
        </tests>
      </program>
    </activity>

    <p>
      We can use a while loop to print out each digit in reverse order starting
      from the right (4, 5, 1 for the number 154) while dividing it by 10. You
      can try it in the active code above. Here is the pseudocode:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>while number is greater than 0</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>print out the last digit using %</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>change the number to cut off the last digit using /</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, let’s write a constructor for the <c>Digits</c> class that uses this
      loop and adds each found digit to the <c>ArrayList</c> instead of printing
      it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this will create the digit list in reverse order. To get the
      digits in the right order, you can use the <c>add(index, obj)</c> method
      to add the digit to the beginning of the <c>ArrayList</c> instead of the
      end.
    </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>ArrayLists</term> are re-sizable lists that allow adding and
            removing items to change their size during run time.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.8.A.4) The <c>ArrayList</c> class is part of the
            <c>java.util</c> package. An <c>import</c> statement can be used to
            make this class available for use in the program.(import
            <c>java.util.ArrayList</c> or <c>java.util.*</c>).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.8.A.1) An <c>ArrayList</c> object is <term>mutable</term> in
            size and contains object references. (Mutable means that it can
            change by adding and removing items from it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.8.A.2) The <c>ArrayList</c> constructor <c>ArrayList()</c>
            constructs an empty list (of size 0).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.8.A.3) Java allows the generic type <c>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</c>,
            where the generic type <c>E</c> specifies the type of the elements.
            (Without it, the type will be <c>Object</c>). When
            <c>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</c> is specified, the types of the reference
            parameters and return type when using its methods are type <c>E</c>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.8.A.3) <c>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</c> is preferred over
            <c>ArrayList</c> (which creates an list of type <c>Object</c>). For
            example, <c>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; names = new
            ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</c> allows the compiler to find errors
            that would otherwise be found at run time.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>ArrayList</c>s cannot hold primitive types like <c>int</c> or
            <c>double</c>, so you must use the wrapper classes <c>Integer</c> or
            <c>Double</c> to put numerical values into an <c>ArrayList</c>.
            However autoboxing usually takes care of that for you.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.8.A.6) The indices for an <c>ArrayList</c> start at <c>0</c>
            and end at the number of elements <c>- 1</c>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>

                  position index and higher to the right (adds 1 to their
                  indices) and adds 1 to size
