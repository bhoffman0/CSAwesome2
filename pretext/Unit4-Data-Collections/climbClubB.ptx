    <p>The following is part b of a free response question from 2012.  It was question 1 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at <url href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year" visual="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year">https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year</url>.</p>
    <p><term>Question 1.</term>  A mountain climbing club maintains a record of the climbs that its members have made. Information about a
            climb includes the name of the mountain peak and the amount of time it took to reach the top. The information is
            contained in the <c>ClimbInfo</c> class as declared below.</p>
    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class ClimbInfo
{
    /**
     * Creates a ClimbInfo object with name peakName and time climbTime.
     *
     * @param peakName the name of the mountain peak
     * @param climbTime the number of minutes taken to complete the climb
     */
    public ClimbInfo(String peakName, int climbTime)
    {
        /* implementation not shown */
    }

    /**
     * @return the name of the mountain peak
     */
    public String getName()
    {
        /* implementation not shown */
    }

    /**
     * @return the number of minutes taken to complete the climb
     */
    public int getTime()
    {
        /* implementation not shown */
    }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods
    // that are not shown.
}
</code>
    </program>
    <p>The <c>ClimbingClub</c> class maintains a list of the climbs made by members of the club. The declaration of the
            <c>ClimbingClub</c> class is shown below. You will write two different implementations of the <c>addClimb</c>
            method. You will also answer two questions about an implementation of the <c>distinctPeakNames</c> method</p>
    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class ClimbingClub
{
    /**
     * The list of climbs completed by members of the club. Guaranteed not to be
     * null. Contains only non-null references.
     */
    private List&lt;ClimbInfo&gt; climbList;

    /** Creates a new ClimbingClub object. */
    public ClimbingClub()
    {
        climbList = new ArrayList&lt;ClimbInfo&gt;();
    }

    /**
     * Adds a new climb with name peakName and time climbTime to the list of
     * climbs.
     *
     * @param peakName the name of the mountain peak climbed
     * @param climbTime the number of minutes taken to complete the climb
     */
    public void addClimb(String peakName, int climbTime)
    {
        /* to be implemented in part (a) */
    }

    /**
     * @return the number of distinct names in the list of climbs
     */
    public int distinctPeakNames()
    {
        /* implementation shown in part (c) */
    }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods
    // that are not shown.
}
</code>
    </program>
    <p><term>Part b.</term>  Write an implementation of the <c>ClimbingClub</c> method <c>addClimb</c> that stores the elements of
            <c>climbList</c> in alphabetical order by name (as determined by the <c>compareTo</c> method of the <c>String</c>
            class). This implementation of <c>addClimb</c> should create a new <c>ClimbInfo</c> object with the given name
            and time and then insert the object into the appropriate position in <c>climbList</c>. Entries that have the
            same name will be grouped together and can appear in any order within the group. For example, consider the
            following code segment.</p>
    <program language="java">
      <code>
ClimbingClub hikerClub = new ClimbingClub();
hikerClub.addClimb("Monadnock", 274);
hikerClub.addClimb("Whiteface", 301);
hikerClub.addClimb("Algonquin", 225);
hikerClub.addClimb("Monadnock", 344);
</code>
    </program>
    <p>When the code segment has completed execution, the instance variable <c>climbList</c> would contain the
            following entries in either of the orders shown below.</p>
