  <introduction>
    <p>
      Files are used to store data in software that we use every day. For
      example, when you play a game on your computer, your game progress is
      saved in a file. The next time you play that game, your game progress is
      loaded in from that file, so you can continue where you left off. In this
      lesson, you will learn how to read in data from a file in Java.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>file</term> is storage for data that <em>persists</em> when the
      program is not running. The data in a file can be retrieved during program
      execution. For example in a previous lesson, you created a
      <c>SpellChecker</c> class that reads in a dictionary file into an array of
      words, and a <c>spellcheck</c> method that uses this array to verify if a
      word is spelled correctly. Input files like the dictionary enable us to
      handle large amounts of data efficiently. Instead of manually entering
      data into our program every time it runs, we can store the data in a file
      and read it as needed. Another benefit of using files is the ability to
      separate the data from the code, allowing for more modular and flexible
      software design.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="File-Scanner-IOException">
    <title>
      Java <c>File</c>, <c>Scanner</c>, and <c>IOException</c> Classes
    </title>

    <p>
      A file can be connected to the program using the <c>File</c> and
      <c>Scanner</c> classes. These classes must be imported in from libraries;
      the <c>Scanner</c> class is in the <c>java.util</c> package and
      <c>File</c> is in the <c>java.io</c> package (
      <title_reference>io</title_reference> stands for
      <term>input/output</term>).
    </p>

    <p>
      A file can be opened by creating a <c>File</c> object, using the name of
      the file or the complete path to the file, as the argument of the
      constructor, for example <c>str</c> is the pathname to the file like
      “data.txt” in <c>new File(String str)</c>.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
import java.io.*;
...
File myFile = new File("data.txt");
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      After opening a file, the <c>Scanner</c> class can be used to read in the
      data from the file line by line. The <c>Scanner</c> class is part of the
      <c>java.util</c> package and has a constructor that takes a <c>File</c>
      object as an argument to create an input stream from the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what if you misspell the file name or the file does not exist? The
      <c>Scanner</c> constructor will throw a <c>FileNotFoundException</c> if it
      cannot find the file. This is a type of <c>IOException</c>, which is a
      general error that is also thrown when the input does not match
      expectations. We’ve seen other exceptions before, like
      <c>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</c> and <c>NullPointerException</c>.
      Exceptions are a way for Java to handle runtime errors that occur during
      program execution. When an exception is thrown, the program stops
      executing and the exception is <em>thrown</em> back to the calling method.
      If the exception is not handled, the program will terminate.
    </p>

    <p>
      When using the <c>File</c> class, Java requires that you indicate what to
      do if the file with the provided name cannot be opened. Java uses
      <c>try/catch</c> blocks to handle exceptions, but you can use the
      <c>throws</c> keyword in the method header to indicate that the method may
      throw an exception instead of handling it there. One way to accomplish
      this is to add <c>throws IOException</c> to the header of the method that
      uses the file. If the file name is invalid, the program will terminate.
      The <term>throws IOException</term> statement is added to the end of the
      method header. Here is an example that sets up an input file in the main
      method and throws an exception.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class FileIO
{
                                          // Notice throws IOException here
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
   {
      File myFile = new File("data.txt");
      Scanner scan = new Scanner(myFile);
      ...

      scan.close();
   }
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Try the following exercise to practice reading in a file. Notice the
      compiler error “unreported exception FileNotFoundException; must be caught
      or declared to be thrown”. Add <term>throws IOException</term> to the end
      of the main method header to fix the error.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Run the code below to see the error message. Add <term>throws</term>
          and the correct exception to the end of the main method header to fix
          the error.

    <p>
      Java forces programmers to handle exceptions because runtime errors can
      crash programs. The <c>throws</c> keyword is used to indicate that a
      method may throw an exception and assumes that it will be handled
      somewhere else. A better way to handle exceptions is to use
      <c>try/catch</c> blocks. These are not used in the AP CSA exam, but you
      will see them in professional Java code. Here is an example of a try/catch
      block that catches the <c>FileNotFoundException</c> exception. Notice that
      it is similar to an if/else statement that could be used for
      error-handling. You put the code that may cause an exception in a try
      block (the Java compiler will let you know if it is needed), and the code
      that handles the exception in a catch block. If the file is not found, the
      appropriate catch block will be executed, and the program will terminate. 
      It can print out the exception message or do something else to handle the exception.
      You will not use try/catch in the AP CSA exam, but here is an example with more information 
      available here <url href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_try_catch.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_try_catch.asp</url>.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
try 
{   
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(myFile);
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) 
{                   
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}

    <title>Reading in Data with Scanner</title>
    <p>
      Once the file is opened, the data can be read using <c>Scanner</c>
      methods. For example, the method, <c>nextLine</c> will read the next line
      of input and returns it as a <c>String</c>. Here are the methods used in
      the Scanner file to read all types of input (also on page 2 of the <url href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference.pdf">Java Quick Reference</url>

          <p>
            <c>Scanner(File f)</c> the Scanner constructor that accepts a File
            for reading.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>String nextLine()</c> returns the next line of text up until the
            end of the line as a String read from the file or input source;
            returns null if there is no next line.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>String next()</c> returns the next String up until a white space

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>int nextInt()</c> returns the next int read from the file or
            input source. If the next <c>int</c> does not exist, it will result
            in an <c>InputMismatchException</c>. Note that this method does not
            read the end of the line, so the next call to <c>nextLine()</c> will
            return the rest of the line which will be empty.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>double nextDouble()</c> returns the next double read from the

            will result in an <c>InputMismatchException</c>.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>boolean nextBoolean()</c> returns the next Boolean read from the
            file or input source. If the next <c>boolean</c> does not exist, it
            will result in an <c>InputMismatchException</c>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>boolean hasNext()</c> returns true if there is a next item to
            read in the file or input source; false otherwise.

      The <c>Scanner</c> class can be used to read input from the keyboard or

      Notice that the <c>nextInt()</c> and <c>nextDouble()</c> methods read in a
      number but leave any space or newline characters on the input stream. This
      can cause problems if you have input to read in multiple lines. Using
      <c>nextLine</c> and the other <c>Scanner</c> methods together on the same
      input source sometimes requires code to adjust for the methods’ different
      ways of handling whitespace. Java programmers will often add in an extra
      call to <c>scan.nextLine();</c> to read in the rest of the line after
      reading in a number.

      character like a comma or a space that separates the units of data. This
      method returns a <c>String</c> array where each element in the array
      represents a field of data from the line.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
String sentence = "A quick brown fox jumps";
// Split the sentence into words along spaces to create:
//  words = {"A", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}
String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Here is an example of how to use the split method to split a line of data
      with commas separating the fields from the Pokemon csv file into
      identifiable chunks of data. The first line of headers in the file
      indicates that the 0th element of the data array is the Pokemon’s number,
      element 1 is the name, etc. We only need to save the data that we want to
      use. In this case, we want to save the name, type1, speed, and imageFile.
      If we want to do math or comparisons with the speed, we can convert it to
      an int using the <c>Integer.parseInt</c> method that will be described in
      the next lesson.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// Split the line of data into an array of Strings
String[] data = line.split(",");
// Identify the data
// data: Number,Name,Type1,Type2,HP,Attack,Defense,Speed,PNG,Description
String name = data[1];
String type1 = data[2];
...
String speed = data[7];
String imageFile = data[8];
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Try the exercise below to display Pokemon images using the <c>split</c>
      method to extract names and urls saved in the file. Note that in the 
      program below, the <c>readFile</c> method may throw an <c>IOException</c> 
      to the calling method <c>main</c>, so both method headers must have the 
      <c>throws IOException</c> clause.

    <title>Object-Oriented Design with CSV Files</title>
    <p>
      To better organize and work with this data, we can create a <c>Pokemon</c>
      class that corresponds to these attributes using object-oriented design. A
      CSV data file can be saved into an array of <c>Pokemon</c> objects by
      splitting each line (except the header) into the attributes for one
      <c>Pokemon</c> object.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use the <c>split</c> method to extract the individual pieces of
      data from each line of the CSV file and save this data into a
      <c>Pokemon</c> object. We must first create a <c>Pokemon</c> class with
      instance variables that correspond to the data attributes, and a
      constructor that initializes these variables. Assuming that we have
      already written the <c>Pokemon</c> class and constructor, the following
      code creates a Pokemon object from the data using its constructor and
      saves it into an array of <c>Pokemon</c> objects.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// Create an array of Pokemon objects
Pokemon[] pokemonArray = new Pokemon[152];

int i = 0;
while (scan.hasNext())
{
    String line = scan.nextLine();
    // Split each line into its attributes name, type1, etc.
    String[] data = line.split(",");
    String name = data[1];
    String type1 = data[2];
    ...
    String speed = data[7];
    String imageFile = data[8];

    // Create a Pokemon object from the split data
    Pokemon p = new Pokemon(name, type1, speed, imageFile);
    // Save p in the array
    pokemonArray[i] = p;

    i++;
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Note that sometimes you may need to skip the 0th row in the file if it is
      column headers. For this file, it will just get split into strings, but if
      your data file contains numbers that need to be processed, you could skip
      one like: <c>if (i == 0) scan.nextLine();</c>.

      to read into an array of objects. The activecode window below is set up to
      use these files. Look at the columns of the dataset you have chosen at the
      bottom of this web page to decide on the name and at least 3 attributes
      for your class. Each row in the data file will be an object of your class
      that you will add to the array. If you find another data CSV file online

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.1) A <term>file</term> is storage for data that persists
            when the program is not running. The data in a file can be retrieved
            during program execution.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.2) A file can be connected to the program using the
            <c>File</c> and <c>Scanner</c> classes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.3) A file can be opened by creating a <c>File</c> object,
            using the name of the file as the argument of the constructor.
            <c>File(String str)</c> is the <c>File</c> constructor that accepts
            a <c>String</c> file name to open for reading, where <c>str</c> is
            the pathname for the file.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.4) When using the <c>File</c> class, it is required to
            indicate what to do if the file with the provided name cannot be
            opened. One way to accomplish this is to add <c>throws
            IOException</c> to the header of the method that uses the file. If
            the file name is invalid, the program will terminate.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.5) The <c>File</c> and <c>IOException</c> classes are part
            of the <c>java.io</c> package. An <c>import</c> statement must be
            used to make these classes available for use in the program.

            (AP 4.6.A.7) Using <c>nextLine</c> and the other <c>Scanner</c>
            methods together on the same input source sometimes requires code to
            adjust for the methods’ different ways of handling whitespace.

            as the condition of the loop.
