    <term>How did he get into computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;I was always interested in video games as a kid. And I thought that was a very magical thing. But my dad also was a system administrator at Boeing. So, he helped me build my own computer and give me access to computers at a really young age. I think those two influences were probably the main things that got me really interested in computers.&#x201D;</em>

    <term>What kind of company does he work at?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;I work at a startup, and I started as employee number three. Now we&#x2019;re at over 200 employees. Th[e] ability to have agency and ownership [at a startup] was very powerful for me.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>Brian started out by working at IBM, a large firm. He eventually transitioned to a start-up because he enjoyed the greater freedom and autonomy there.</p>

  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;There is some level of motivation now around teaching others&#x2026; There&#x2019;s the level of understanding where you can work or do something, and then there&#x2019;s a level of understanding that you actually need to be able to effectively articulate that to someone. There&#x2019;s a slight difference. And it also just allows you to see it from a new perspective.&#x201D;</em>

  <p>
    <term>What subfield is he interested in?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;I came from doing a very different kind of programming to doing web development. I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing, and a lot of it was learning.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>Bryan is currently a manager, but he started with his company as a web developer. He actually entered the industry as a low-level, database programmer. Once he joined his current company, he made the transition to web development.</p>
