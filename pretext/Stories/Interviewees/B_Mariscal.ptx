    "I love learning about new technologies and trying them out. I know that if
    I keep digging at them, it will click, and I will learn them. Just knowing
    that I know that I can learn helps make me love the field."

      “In 2016, I was working as a security guard at Jack in the Box. During that time, I met my boyfriend. He was the one that encouraged me to go into tech, because a friend of his told him that, hey, you can just self-study. It was very hard for me. But he kept pushing me and telling me, ‘Yeah, I think you can do it. You’re very smart. You can do it. You can definitely do it.’”

    <term>How does she view CS?</term>
  </p>

    <em>
      “I was an anthropology major. I was always trying to figure out how the world worked and how humans interact. As a software engineer, I get to see the part of life as a member of that society. I previously read books about how tech impacts society, but being inside this field gives me another perspective.”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming from an anthropology background, Briceida views CS in an
    interdisplinary manner, where she highlights the anthropological aspects of
    it. That gives her a unique perspective.

      “A role model for me was my previous tech lead. He was a white man. I admired him because he was humble. He was not arrogant. He treated me like an equal. He explained things to me like an equal. I consider him a role model, because that’s something that I want to achieve once I become a tech lead.”

    <term>What subfield is she interested in?</term>

      “During the bootcamp was when I decided that I wanted to be a back-end developer. I did not want to do front end, because it’s a different kind of programming where you’re gluing things together. I just didn’t find it interesting.”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Briceida does back-end developing, where she builds and maintains the
    server-side components of web services.
