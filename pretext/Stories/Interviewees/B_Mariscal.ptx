        <p><raw classes="raw-html" format="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;font color="CadetBlue"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I love learning about new technologies and trying them out. I know that if I keep digging at them, it will click, and I will learn them. Just knowing that I know that I can learn helps make me love the field."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</raw></p>
        <p><term>How did she get into computing?</term></p>
        <p><em>“In 2016, I was working as a security guard at Jack in the Box. During that time, I met my boyfriend. He was the one that encouraged me to go into tech, because a friend of his told him that, hey, you can just self-study. It was very hard for me. But he kept pushing me and telling me, ‘Yeah, I think you can do it. You’re very smart. You can do it. You can definitely do it.’”</em></p>
        <p><term>How does she view CS?</term></p>
        <p><em>“I was an anthropology major. I was always trying to figure out how the world worked and how humans interact. As a software engineer, I get to see the part of life as a member of that society. I previously read books about how tech impacts society, but being inside this field gives me another perspective.”</em></p>
        <p>Coming from an anthropology background, Briceida views CS in an interdisplinary manner, where she highlights the anthropological aspects of it. That gives her a unique perspective.</p>
        <p><term>Who does she look up to?</term></p>
        <p><em>“A role model for me was my previous tech lead. He was a white man. I admired him because he was humble. He was not arrogant. He treated me like an equal. He explained things to me like an equal. I consider him a role model, because that’s something that I want to achieve once I become a tech lead.”</em></p>
        <p><term>What subfield is she interested in?</term></p>
        <p><em>“During the bootcamp was when I decided that I wanted to be a back-end developer. I did not want to do front end, because it’s a different kind of programming where you’re gluing things together. I just didn’t find it interesting.”</em></p>
        <p>Briceida does back-end developing, where she builds and maintains the server-side components of web services.</p>
