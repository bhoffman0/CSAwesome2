    <term>Why did she choose computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;Originally I was considering studying English in college. [My parents] went to a seminar about careers in CS. The more that I did it and the more I learned how to be creative with computer science, the more it became something that I wanted to keep doing. For me who wanted to study English, who always did arts and crafts, I didn&#x2019;t really connect to CS as something I wanted to continue until I saw how I could still be creative.
                [In] my first internship, I was an intern that worked on an AR team and we developed a drawing app to draw in 3D.
                I realized all the debugging and hard math felt worth it when I got to see something &#x2014; it connected [that] I was doing this thing that was very creative.&#x201D;</em>

    <term>What challenges has she faced in computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;In the beginning, I was discouraged by the fact that sometimes you meet people who start really, really young. When you get to college, there&#x2019;s people who have been programming since they were 10 or 12. They tend to be guys, and they tend to be really cavalier about it. That was really discouraging &#x2014; someone was asking a question and they were making fun of it. They were like, &#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s such a stupid question. Didn&#x2019;t we do this yesterday.&#x201D; Even though there are so many beginners, the voices of people who have more experience are the loudest.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>Destini has faced a challenge that many in CS face: impostor syndrome. Since the loudest voices tend to also be the most experienced, average students perceive themselves as behind the curve.</p>
  <p>
    <term>What subfield is she pursuing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>Destini is studying computer science, a branch of computing that deals with mathematical models, analysis, and algorithms.</p>

    <term>Why did she choose computer science?</term>

    <em>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s things that have to do with tech that aren&#x2019;t strict coding or sometimes seen as what female engineers are drawn to &#x2014; typically being UI or UX. It&#x2019;s the stereotype of women being drawn to soft skills that made me want to get a degree in something that people couldn&#x2019;t dispute was CS. It made me want, at the minimum, to have a piece of paper that said computer science. I could point at it and say, &#x2018;No, no I learned computer science.&#x2019;&#x201D;</em>
