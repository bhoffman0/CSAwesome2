I have pet guinea pigs I'm obsessed with. I like to craft. I like to read different kinds of literature."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</raw>

    <term>How did she get into computer science?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;My dad was a self-learner and instilled that on me. He bought computer architecture books. I did not understand, but I appreciated that he tried even though his background is not at all technical. Even my mom didn&#x2019;t really know what was happening, but she was always like, &#x2018;Yeah, you can do it.&#x2019;&#x201D;</em>

    <term>What challenges has she faced in computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;My first time ever TA&#x2019;ing for a lab, there was a student who was very frustrated that they didn&#x2019;t get to them, and they were like, &#x2018;Oh, well, she&#x2019;s supposed to know everything, but she&#x2019;s female, so maybe not.&#x2019; I cried for the whole day. Those really small punches put a strain in my progress. They don&#x2019;t happen often now. But if the same types of comments were to happen now, I would brush them off&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;I went to kind of a workshop, and I was the only female Latina in a group of kind of white, old males, and they decided to kind of make an example of me as a token, and that reduced my feeling of being a part of a community.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>Carla, being a female Latina, is at the intersection of two underrepresented groups in computing. That has led to isolation and disrespect throughout her career.</p>
  <p>
    <term>What subfield does she work in?</term>
  </p>
  <p>Carla researches the intersection between human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer science education.</p>
  <p>
    <term>How did she get into research?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;Most of my undergrad summers were doing research. The research programs I did pushed me to do grad school. I went to Tapia, a diversity conference for people in computing. They were very welcoming and always gave me feedback. I was starting to develop my own mini self-image as a researcher. I started to see academia as a noble pursuit. I felt like there was a grander purpose rather than working for a company.&#x201D;</em>
