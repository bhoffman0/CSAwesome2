    <raw classes="raw-html" format="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;font color="CadetBlue"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I don't think that your identity has to be tied to what you do. If anything, the skills needed for the job &#x2014; learning new ideas and new technologies &#x2014; identifies an individual that likes to play with things."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</raw>

    <term>Why did he choose computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;I love the possibility that with the knowledge and the skills, a small type of computing instrument and the resource of time and discipline, sky is the limit. So I really like the opportunity to create anything really.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>Like countless other programmers, Eric enjoys how programming enables him to build whatever he can think of, whether it&#x2019;s helping him, his employer, or the world.</p>
  <p>
    <term>How did he pursue computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>Eric studied at a full-stack boot camp &#x2014; a boot camp that teaches both front-end (constructing the components that users interact with) and back-end development (building the technologies that facilitate the front end).</p>
  <p>
    <term>What subfield is he working in?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;Yeah, I&#x2019;m a DevOps engineer &#x2014; [a role that] basically writes code that works within a company so that a developer can use that pipeline that I helped create. And they can send that code throughout the company so that the customer never sees the test code or the code that&#x2019;s in work &#x2014; they only see the final product. The work that I do is creating the pipeline to take the code that the developers use from start to finish.&#x201D;</em>

  <p>
    <term>Who does he look up to?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;[A big mentor] was a teacher that basically showed me the way to speak. I took more than just the coding skills themselves. I was able to see that person as a mentor beyond just coding and see their accomplishments and what they were able to do beyond it and then also why they code. It was lucky to find a master in the field that not only was a very technically inclined and skilled coder but also just a general good human being that I respected and admired.&#x201D;</em>
