    <term>How did she get into computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;My friends. We all had to build our own little websites for class. We would have our own mini competitions to see whose would be the nicest, so that was very friend-driven. Nowadays, it&#x2019;s more about my own passion for the field.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>What did she study as an undergrad?</term>
  </p>
  <p>Luisa started college as an English major and eventually transitioned to an economics major. Once she graduated, she started a media consulting company, which included a bit of web development with WordPress and other tools. That kept her engaged in computing, which is why she decided to go further into technology.</p>
  <p>
    <term>How does her interdisciplinary experience affect her career now?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;Having a background in economics helps me understand the impact of the software that I write, how I can impact the business, and how I can add to more revenue, customers, or whatever it might be. Having done marketing, I understand the importance of having a clear message, so all of that is part of just being better at communication.&#x201D;</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>How did she pursue computing?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;I decided to teach myself how to program. I did some online, worked on some side projects, and ran through some online courses. I worked for three-and-a-half or four years, and then I decided to do the master&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</em>

  <p>
    <term>What obstacles has she faced?</term>
  </p>
  <p>Like many other developers, Luisa dealt with imposter syndrome. This syndrome was compounded by the fact that she is self-taught, Hispanic (a racial minority), and female (a gender minority).</p>
  <p>She has dealt with impostor syndrome in two ways. First, she&#x2019;s begun to accept that she won&#x2019;t know everything. No matter how much she studies, no matter how much experience she has, there will always be problems she can&#x2019;t solve, and that&#x2019;s okay. Secondly, she&#x2019;s started reading about other people&#x2019;s experiences with impostor syndrome. Realizing that it&#x2019;s a common issue makes her feel less alone.</p>
  <p>
    <term>What does she work as?</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>&#x201C;My initial interest was in back end development, which just means that we work closer on the data side. I couldn&#x2019;t find really good resources for picking it up. It was hard for me to figure out what the code that I was writing was doing, which is why I ended up in front end development (where you develop the interface that users interact with). That was one switch, and now I did front end development for about three-and-a-half to four years. [Now,] my focus is back on being on back end development, purely because I want to be more familiar with that side of software engineering.&#x201D;</em>
