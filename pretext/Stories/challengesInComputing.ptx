  <title>Challenges In Computing</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>There are many challenges that real-world computing professionals have to deal with everyday. In this assignment, you will learn about a few obstacles and how people have tackled them.</p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="UNIQUE-ID-001187">
    <title>Impostor Syndrome</title>
    <p>Impostor syndrome is when competent individuals doubt their own abilities. In other words, it&#x2019;s when skilled people feel like frauds or impostors.</p>
    <p>This obstacle is one of the most widespread issues in programming. Across age, experience level, and gender, almost everyone experiences impostor syndrome at some point in their career.</p>
    <p>Many of the individuals interviewed for CSAwesome detail similar experiences. For example, <xref ref="interviewees_c_-mbayo"/> explains how it affected her journey:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#x201C;People try to sound more knowledgeable than they are, and to someone who doesn&#x2019;t know, that sounds like they know what they&#x2019;re talking about. That definitely made me feel like I was behind. I never fully believed that I was a computer scientist until I had an internship.&#x201D;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Luckily for Camille, her internship reaffirmed her value as a computer scientist. That doesn&#x2019;t work for everyone, though &#x2014; especially professionals that are already in the field.</p>
    <p>A more fullproof way of tackling impostor syndrome is to realize that working entails always learning. Everyone pretends like you either know computer science or you don&#x2019;t, but there&#x2019;s a lot of learning in the middle. The constant releases of new technology mean that everyone is constantly learning.</p>

    <title>A Lack of Diversity</title>
    <p>Computing has always suffered from a lack of diversity. Even though female professionals like Ada Lovelace (the first programmer) were crucial to the development of modern computers, the field is still male-dominated. Similarly, despite minority programmers like Marian Croak (the inventor of VoIP) and Guillermo Diaz Jr. (the CIO of Cisco for twenty years), many black, indigenous, and hispanic programmers feel isolated.</p>
    <p>The problem is twofold: a lack of role models and a lack of peers.</p>
    <p>A lack of role models that &#x201C;look like them&#x201D; deters many racial &amp; gender minorities from entering computing. For example, as <xref ref="interviewees_c_-mbayo"/> explains:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#x201C;Our computer science department had one woman teacher, and the whole engineering school only had one black women. And then she got pregnant and left for a while. The diversity was so small, so it was hard for me to find support.&#x201D;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Having a role model shows students that the path they travel isn&#x2019;t impossible. It makes a career in computing seem more attainable and possible.</p>
    <p>A lack of relatable peers can also lead to similar feelings of isolation. Students are often left out of study groups or social events, while professionals are excluded from after-work parties or passed over for promotions. As <xref ref="interviewees_c_-de_-lira"/> explains:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#x201C;Everyone had their own study group. All of the international students were very close knit. All of the domestic students, mostly white, were in their own group. And I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. I guess I&#x2019;m soloing this.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The solution to a lack of relatable peers is to seek out support groups or communities for your demographic. As <xref ref="interviewees_b_-mariscal"/> explains:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#x201C;One thing that I started doing was mentoring other Latinas. Helping them has made me feel like I&#x2019;m being part of something bigger than myself. I&#x2019;m not only paying it forward, but I&#x2019;m also no longer feeling lonely.&#x201D;</p>
