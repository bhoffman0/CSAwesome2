    CSAwesome2 is the second edition of CSAwesome, a free AP CSA curriculum that
    is endorsed by the College Board as an official AP CSA curriculum and PD
    provider for the 2025-2026 AP CSA revision. It was revised by Dr. Beryl
    Hoffman, Professor of Computer Science at Elms College, MA. Special thanks
    to Leigh Anne Fitz of Virginia Beach Public Schools for debugging and
    creating the solutions for teachers and the students in CIT 215 at STCC in
    Spring 2025 for testing and debugging. Special thanks to Kate McDonnell from
    Cherry Creek Schools in CO who created a JUnit test code suite and many of
    the unit tests for autograding and for revising the lesson plans with help
    from Kimberly Polin from Williston Northampton School in MA. And many thanks
    to Peter Seibel from Berkeley High School for his edits and code to
    help with the conversion to PreTeXt.
  </p>

  <p>
    CSAwesome was originally created in 2019 as a free AP CSA curriculum by
    adapting the AP CSA Java Review e-book written by Dr. Barbara Ericson, while
    she was a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, currently Assistant
    Professor of Information at University of Michigan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dr. Beryl Hoffman, Professor of Computer Science at Elms College, MA,
    created and adapted the CSAwesome curriculum to follow the College Board CSA
    2019 guidelines with the support of a 2019 Google CS-ER grant and the Mobile
    CSP project (<url href="https://www.mobile-csp.org"
    visual="https://www.mobile-csp.org">https://www.mobile-csp.org</url>) to
    help transition students and teachers from AP CSP to AP CSA. Special thanks
    to Barb Ericson, Beth Simon, Colleen Lewis (for her awesome Java memory
    model videos), John Figliulo, Pauline Lake, Jennifer Rosato, Kim Evelti,
    Becky Stacey, Art Lopez, Kyle Gillette, and Peter Bowers for feedback,
    edits, and ideas.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the summer of 2020, CSA teacher extraordinaire Kate McDonnell from Cherry
    Creek Schools in CO created a JUnit test code suite for our Java servers to
    provide feedback to students in every active code. Many volunteers including
    Pat Clark, Emma Brown, Emma Pinnell, Megha Sharma, Arjun Balaji, and Anvita
    Gollu helped to add many junit tests to each active code to make them
    auto-gradable.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the summer of 2023, Peter Seibel, author, software developer, and
    Berkeley High School AP CSA teacher, made valuable improvements to the
    CSAwesome text and Runestone platform.
