  <title>About the AP CSA Exam</title>
  <p>
    This curriculum will prepare you for the Advanced Placement Computer Science
    A Exam which tests your programming skills in Java.
  </p>

  <p>
    The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections: multiple choice and
    free-response. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
    first part has 42 multiple-choice questions worth 55% of your grade, and the
    second part has 4 free response questions (FRQs), where you write Java code,
    worth 45% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the <url

  </p>

  <p>
    The 4 free response questions are shorter than previous years and cover the
    following areas to total 25 points (from <url

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Free Response Question 1 Methods and Control Structures (7
            points)</term>: Students will write two methods or one constructor
            and one method of a given class based on provided specifications and
            examples. In Part A (4 points), the method or constructor will
            require students to write iterative or conditional statements, or
            both, as well as statements that call methods in the specified
            class. In Part B (3 points), the method or constructor will require
            calling <term>String</term> methods (which is different from AP FRQs
            prior to 2026).

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Free Response Question 2 Class Design (7 points)</term>:
            Students will be instructed to design and implement a class based on
            provided specifications and examples. A second class might also be
            included. Students will be provided with a scenario and
            specifications in the form of a table demonstrating ways to interact
            with the class and the results. The class must include a class
            header, instance variables, a constructor, a method, and
            implementation of the constructor and required method. (Inheritance
            is no longer covered in the AP exam and FRQs.)

          <p>
            <term>Free Response Question 3 Data Analysis with ArrayList (5
            points)</term>: Students will be provided with a scenario and its
            associated class(es).Students will write one method of a given class
            based on provided specifications and examples. The method requires
            students to use, analyze,and manipulate data in an
            <term>ArrayList</term> structure. (Arrays will not be tested in an
            FRQ.)

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Free Response Question 4 2D Array (6 points)</term>: Students
            will be provided with a scenario and its associated class(es).
            Students will write one method of a given class based on provided
            specifications and examples. The method requires students to use,
            analyze,and manipulate data in a <term>2D array</term> structure.
            (This usually requires the use of nested loops.)

  <p>
    The College Board specifies the AP CSA course in the 4 units shown in the
    table below. On the College Board’s AP Portal they provide formative
    assessments called Personal Progress Checks for each unit. This CSAwesome
    curriculum is organized around the AP CSA units and also provides many
    interactive exercises in each unit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The College Board also requires AP CSA courses to provide at least 20 hours
    of lab time for you to practice Java programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    The table below reflects the 2025-2026 revisions to AP CSA where the content
    is reorganized into 4 large units. The new unit 1 is a combination of the
    old units 1 &amp; 2, the new unit 2 is a combination of the old units 3
    &amp; 4, the new unit 3 corresponds to the old unit 5, and the new unit 4 is
    a combination of the old units 6, 7, 8, and 10. The old unit 9 on
    inheritance is no longer a part of the AP CSA exam but is included as an
    optional unit 5 in CSAwesome2.
