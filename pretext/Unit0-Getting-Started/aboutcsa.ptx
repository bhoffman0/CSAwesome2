  <title>About the AP CSA Exam</title>
  <p>This curriculum will prepare you for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A
            Exam which tests your programming skills in Java.</p>
  <p>The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections&#x2014;multiple choice and
            free-response. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
            first part has 40 multiple-choice questions, and the second part has 4 free
            response questions where you have to write Java code by hand. Each part is worth
            50% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the <raw format="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;AP CSA Java Quick Reference Sheet&lt;/a&gt;</raw>.</p>
  <p>The 4 free response questions cover the following areas (from <raw format="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/assessment" target="_blank"&gt;AP CSA Free Response&lt;/a&gt;</raw>):</p>

  <p>The College Board specifies the AP CSA course in the 10 units shown in the table
            below. On the College Board&#x2019;s AP Portal they provide formative assessments
            called Personal Progress Checks for each unit. This CSAwesome curriculum is
            organized around the AP CSA units and also provides many interactive exercises
            in each unit.</p>
  <p>The College Board also requires AP CSA courses to provide at least 20 hours of
            lab time for you to practice Java programming.</p>
