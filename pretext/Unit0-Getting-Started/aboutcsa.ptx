        <title>About the AP CSA Exam</title>
        <p>This curriculum will prepare you for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A
            Exam which tests your programming skills in Java.</p>
        <p>The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections—multiple choice and
            free-response. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
            first part has 40 multiple-choice questions, and the second part has 4 free
            response questions where you have to write Java code by hand. Each part is worth
            50% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the <problematic refid="id1">|AP CSA
                Reference Sheet|</problematic>.</p>
        <p>The 4 free response questions cover the following areas (from <url href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/assessment" visual="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/assessment">AP CSA Free Response</url>):</p>

                        code to create objects of a class and call methods, and satisfy method
                        specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative

        <p>The College Board specifies the AP CSA course in the 4 units shown in the table
            below. On the College Board’s AP Portal they provide formative assessments
            called Personal Progress Checks for each unit. This CSAwesome curriculum is
            organized around the AP CSA units and also provides many interactive exercises
            in each unit.</p>
        <p>The College Board also requires AP CSA courses to provide at least 20 hours of
            lab time for you to practice Java programming.</p>
        <p>The table below reflects the 2025-2026 revisions to AP CSA where the content is reorganized into 4 large units. The new unit 1 is a combination of the old units 1 &amp; 2, the new unit 2 is a combination of the old units 3 &amp; 4, the new unit 3 corresponds to the old unit 5, and the new unit 4 is a combination of the old units 6, 7, 8, and 10. The old unit 9 on inheritance is no longer a part of the AP CSA exam but is included as an optional unit 5 in CSAwesome2.</p>
