        <title>Pretest for the AP CSA Exam</title>
        <p>Please try the following pretest. We don’t expect you to know the answers to these questions at all yet! So don’t worry about it if you don’t know the answers. If you have no idea on the answer, it is okay to skip questions or to make your best guess.</p>
        <p>You will take the same test at the end of the class, and the goal is to see how much you improve. We hope that everyone will see a big improvement!</p>
        <p>Please make sure you are logged into Runestone before beginning. Click the <image source="Unit0-Getting-Started/Figures/start.png" width="50%" alt="start"/> button when you are ready to begin the exam. You can only take the exam once. There are no time limits, but it will keep track of how much time you take.  Click on the <image source="Unit0-Getting-Started/Figures/next.png" width="50%" alt="next"/> button to go to the next question.  Click on the <image source="Unit0-Getting-Started/Figures/prev.png" width="50%" alt="previous"/> button to go to the previous question.  Use the number buttons to jump to a particular question.  Click the <image source="Unit0-Getting-Started/Figures/pause.png" width="50%" alt="pause"/> button to pause the exam (you will not be able to see the questions when the exam is paused).  Click on the <image source="Unit0-Getting-Started/Figures/finishExam.png" width="50%" alt="finish exam"/> button after you have answered all the questions.  The number correct, number wrong, and number skipped will be displayed.</p>

The variable var1 has 1 added to it for a new value of 1. The variable var2 has 1 subtracted from it for a value of 1. At this point var1=1 and var2=1. The while condition is checked again. Since var2 isn't 0 (1!=0) and var1/var2 (1/1=1) is &gt;= 0 so the body of the loop will execute again. The variable var1 has 1 added to it for a new value of 2. The variable var2 has 1 subtracted from it for a value of 0. At this point var1=2 and var2=0. The while condition is checked again. Since var2 is zero the while loop stops and the value of var1 is 2 and var2 is 0.</p>

                    <p>This is almost right. It has Susan as 5 years older than Matt now. But the second part is wrong. Multiplication will be done before addition so (2 * m + 3) won't be correct for in 3 years Susan will be twice as old as Matt. It should be (2 * (m + 3)) or (2 * m + 6).</p>

                    <p>This is the definition of encapsulation and this is done in Java using private (a member is directly accessible only in the class that defines it) and protected (a member is directly accessible only within code in the same package and in subclasses).</p>

            <p> Which of the following reasons for using an inheritance heirarchy are valid?</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
I.   Methods from a superclass can be used in a subclass without
     rewriting or copying code.
II.  Objects from subclasses can be passed as arguments to a method
     designed for the superclass
III. Objects from subclasses can be stored in the same array
IV.  All of the above
V.   None of the above

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>In fact, all of the reasons listed are valid. Subclasses can reuse methods written for superclasses without code replication, subclasses can be stored in the same array, and passed as arguments to methods meant for the superclass. All of which make writing code more streamlined.</p>

                    <p>III is also valid. In some cases you might want to store subclasses together in a single array, and inheritance allows for this.</p>

                    <p>II is also valid. In some cases a single method is applicable for a number of subclasses, and inheritance allows you to pass objects of the subclasses to the same method instead of writing individual methods for each subclass.</p>
