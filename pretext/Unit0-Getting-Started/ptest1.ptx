  <p>
    Please try the following pretest. We don’t expect you to know the answers to
    these questions at all yet! So don’t worry about it if you don’t know the
    answers. If you have no idea on the answer, it is okay to skip questions or
    to make your best guess.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will take the same test at the end of the class, and the goal is to see
    how much you improve. We hope that everyone will see a big improvement!
  </p>

    Please make sure you are logged into Runestone before beginning. Click the
    Start button when you are ready to begin the exam. You can only take the
    exam once. There are no time limits, but it will keep track of how much time
    you take. Click on the Next button to go to the next question. Click on the
    Prev button to go to the previous question. Use the number buttons to jump
    to a particular question. Click the Pause button to pause the exam (you will
    not be able to see the questions when the exam is paused). Click on the
    Finish button after you have answered all the questions. The number correct,
    number wrong, and number skipped will be displayed.

              This would be true if the loop was printing each character twice

              This will loop through the string and print two characters at a
              time. The first time through the loop index = 0 and it will print
              "12". The second time through the loop index = 2 and it will print
              "34". The third time through the loop index = 4 and it will print
              "56". Remember that the substring method that takes two integer
              values will start the substring at the first value and include up
              to the character before the second value.

              The variable lenCount is incremented each time the current array

              counts the number of occurrences of the value target in nums. The
              method returns maxLen which is set to lenCount after the loop
              finishes if lenCount is greater than maxLen.

              The loop starts with var1=0 and var2=2. The while checks that var2
              isn't 0 (2!=0) and that var1 / var2 is greater than or equal to
              zero (0/2=0) so this is equal to zero and the body of the while
              loop will execute. The variable var1 has 1 added to it for a new
              value of 1. The variable var2 has 1 subtracted from it for a value
              of 1. At this point var1=1 and var2=1. The while condition is
              checked again. Since var2 isn't 0 (1!=0) and var1/var2 (1/1=1) is
              &gt;= 0 so the body of the loop will execute again. The variable
              var1 has 1 added to it for a new value of 2. The variable var2 has
              1 subtracted from it for a value of 0. At this point var1=2 and
              var2=0. The while condition is checked again. Since var2 is zero
              the while loop stops and the value of var1 is 2 and var2 is 0.

              This would be true if Susan was 5 years younger than Matt and

              This is almost right. It has Susan as 5 years older than Matt now.
              But the second part is wrong. Multiplication will be done before
              addition so (2 * m + 3) won't be correct for in 3 years Susan will
              be twice as old as Matt. It should be (2 * (m + 3)) or (2 * m +
              6).

              This can't be right because Susan is 5 years older than Matt, so
              the first part is wrong. It has Susan equal to Matt's age minus 5

              The value of num the first time through the loop is 0 so the first

              This can't be true because a[1]--; means the same as a[1] = a[1] -
              1; so the 3 changes to 2. Parameters are all pass by value in Java
              which means that a copy of the value is passed to a method. But,
              since an array is an object a copy of the value is a copy of the
              reference to the object. So changes to objects in methods are
              permanent.

              This has a recursive call which means that the method calls itself
              when (x / 10) is greater than or equal to zero. Each time the
              method is called it prints the remainder of the passed value
              divided by 10 and then calls the method again with the result of
              the integer division of the passed number by 10 (which throws away
              the decimal part). After the recursion stops by (x / 10) == 0 the
              method will print the remainder of the passed value divided by 10
              again.

              The variable i loops from 1 to 6 and each time the values are as
              follows: i = 1, t = 10, a = 4, b = 9, i = 2, t = 4, a = 11, b =2,
              i = 3, t = 11, a = 5, b = 8, i = 4, t = 5, a = 12, b = 1, i = 5, t
              = 12, a = 6, b = 7, i = 6, t = 6, a = 13, b = 0

              Data (fields) can be directly accessed by all code in all classes.

              Encapsulation is making data private so only code in the same
              class has direct access.

              Data (fields) can be hidden inside of an object using the abstract

              There is no abstract visibility modifier. You cannot use the
              keyword abstract on variable declarations.

              This is the definition of encapsulation and this is done in Java
              using private (a member is directly accessible only in the class
              that defines it) and protected (a member is directly accessible
              only within code in the same package and in subclasses).

              Data (fields) are directly accessible by objects in the same
              package and in subclasses.

              Encapsulation means that only code in the defining class has
              direct access. The visibility modifier protected gives direct
              access to code in classes in the same package and subclasses.

              Encapsulation means that only code in the defining class has
              direct access. The default package access gives direct access to
              code in classes in the same package.
