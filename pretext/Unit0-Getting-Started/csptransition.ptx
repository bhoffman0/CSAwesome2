        <title>Transitioning from AP CSP to AP CSA</title>
        <p>If you have taken the AP CSP (Computer Science Principles) course and exam you
            should be well prepared for AP CSA. However, there are likely to be a few new
            things to get used to. If your CSP class used a block coding language like App
            Inventor, Scratch, Snap!, or App Lab, you learned to create program structures
            by plugging together blocks. In Java you’ll find the structures are similar but
            you’ll have to get used to expressing them in text.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you’ve previously used a different text-based language,
            such as Python or Javascript, while you will be used to the idea of writing
            programs in text you’ll have to get used to some specific details of Java’s
            syntax.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when you are writing Java code, especially if
            your prior programming experience was with a block language:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>You must spell things correctly, or at least consistently. Unlike in a block
                    programming language where you know you are using the right block because you
                    dragged it from a palette, in Java names are what connect different parts of
                    your program and they need to be spelled consistently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You must pay attention to case: names that differ only in case—one starting
                    with a lower-case letter and the other with an upper-case letter, for
                    instance—are still different.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Punctuation is important. In particular, most statements in Java need to end
                    with a semicolon (<c>;</c>). Leave a required semicolon out and your program
                    won’t run. That’s different than this paragraph which you can still read even
                    though we forgot the period at the end of this sentence</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Java is in the family of programming languages that use curly braces (<c>{}</c>)
                    to group together statements. The curly brace notation may be familiar to you
                    from the AP CSP pseudocode which uses them in a similar way.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You should match the indentation of your code to the structure created by your
                    curly braces.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
