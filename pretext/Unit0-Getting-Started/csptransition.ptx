  <title>Transitioning from AP CSP to AP CSA</title>
  <p>
    If you have taken the AP CSP (Computer Science Principles) course and exam
    you should be well prepared for AP CSA. However, there are likely to be a
    few new things to get used to. If your CSP class used a block coding
    language like App Inventor, Scratch, Snap!, or App Lab, you learned to
    create program structures by plugging together blocks. In Java you’ll find
    the structures are similar but you’ll have to get used to expressing them in
    text.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, if you’ve previously used a different text-based
    language, such as Python or Javascript, while you will be used to the idea
    of writing programs in text you’ll have to get used to some specific details
    of Java’s syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some tips to keep in mind when you are writing Java code,
    especially if your prior programming experience was with a block language:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You must spell things correctly, or at least consistently. Unlike in a
          block programming language where you know you are using the right
          block because you dragged it from a palette, in Java names are what
          connect different parts of your program and they need to be spelled
          consistently.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You must pay attention to case: names that differ only in case—one
          starting with a lower-case letter and the other with an upper-case
          letter, for instance—are still different.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Punctuation is important. In particular, most statements in Java need
          to end with a semicolon (<c>;</c>). Leave a required semicolon out and
          your program won’t run. That’s different than this paragraph which you
          can still read even though we forgot the period at the end of this
          sentence
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Java is in the family of programming languages that use curly braces
          (<c>{}</c>) to group together statements. The curly brace notation may
          be familiar to you from the AP CSP pseudocode which uses them in a
          similar way.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You should match the indentation of your code to the structure created
          by your curly braces.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
