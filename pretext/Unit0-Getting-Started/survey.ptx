            <p>Sisters Rise Up is a research study at the University of Michigan that is trying to determine ways to help women of color (Black, Latinx, and/or Native American) who are taking Advanced Placement Computer Science A (CSA) succeed in the course and on the exam.  It offers free remote one-hour help sessions twice a week which are led by undergraduate students at the University of Michigan.

            <p>Sisters Rise Up will cover concepts on the AP CS exams, answer your questions, and introduce you to role models.
