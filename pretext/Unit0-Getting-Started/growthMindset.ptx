    <title>Growth Mindset</title>
    <p>
      Learning to code can be hard at times and sometimes frustrating. However,
      the feeling you get when your code works is incredible! And your brain
      grows as you problem solve and debug your programs!

      To practice using a growth mindset, if you find yourself saying or
      thinking what’s in the left column, try substituting what’s in the right
      column instead:

          <cell bottom="minor" right="minor">Instead of:</cell>

    <title>Pair Programming</title>
    <p>
      In this curriculum, you are encouraged to work together in pairs to
      complete the coding challenges. <term>Pair programming</term> is a
      successful software development technique where two programmers work
      together at one computer. One, the driver, types in code while the other,
      the navigator, gives ideas and feedback. The two coders switch roles
      frequently. You can also try buddy programming where each person uses
      their own computer but both help each other while coding. The advantages
      of pair programming are that two heads are better than one, and pairs
      usually produce better code with less roadblocks. As future software
      developers, it’s also important to learn to work in teams.
