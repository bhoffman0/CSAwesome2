                <feedback>
                    <p>A constructor is often used to initialize the fields to their default values or in the case of a parameterized constructor, to the values passed in to the constructor.</p>

        <p>  A car dealership needs a program to store information about the cars for sale. For each car, they want to keep track of the following information: number of doors (2 or 4), whether the car has air conditioning, and its average number of miles per gallon. Which of the following is the best design?</p>

            <choice>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Only <code>Car</code> should be a class. The number of doors, flag if it has air conditioning, and the average number of miles per gallon are attributes of a car so they belong in a <code>Car</code> class.</p>

                    <p>The number of doors, flag if it has air conditioning, and the average number of miles per gallon are attributes of a car. Each of these is a simple value so they can just be fields of a <code>Car</code> class.</p>

                    <p>A door is not a type of car. A flag for air conditioning is not a type of door, and a miles per gallon is not a type of air conditioning flag. Child classes need to be able to be substituted for the parent class.</p>

                    <p>A class <code>Car</code> can't be a subclass of three different classes. Each class can only have one parent class. Also a car is not a type of door, air conditioning flag, or miles per gallon. Child classes need to be able to be substituted for the parent class.</p>

        <p> A bookstore is working on an on-line ordering system. For each type of published material (books, movies, audio tapes) they need to track the id, title, author(s), date published, and price. Which of the following would be the best design?</p>

        </statement>
<choices>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>Create one class <code>PublishedMaterial</code> with the requested fields plus type.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>This will complicate the process of retrieving objects based on their type. Also if we need to add information that is specific to <code>Book</code> or <code>Movie</code> or <code>AudioTape</code> it would be best if these were subclasses of <code>PublishedMaterial</code>.</p>
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>

                    <p>Create classes <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code> with the requested fields.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>This involves writing more code than is necessary (usually people copy and paste the shared code) and makes it harder to fix errors. It would be better to put common fields and methods in the superclass <code>PublishedMaterial</code> and have <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code> be subclasses.</p>
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>

                    <p>Create one class <code>BookStore</code> with the requested fields plus type.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>The class name, <code>BookStore</code>, seems to imply the thing that keeps track of the store. This would be an appropriate class name for an object that handles the items in the <code>Bookstore</code>. However, for the published material, it would be better to use a superclass <code>PublishedMaterial</code> and subclasses for <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code> and <code>AudioTape</code>.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>This is more classes than is necessary. Items such as <code>Title</code>, <code>Price</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>Author</code> and <code>DatePublished</code> are simple variables that do not need a class of their own but should be fields in a <code>PublishedMaterial</code> superclass, with <code>Movie</code>, <code>AudioTape</code> and <code>Book</code> as subclasses.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>We will need to get objects based on their type so we should create classes for <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code>. They have common fields so we should put these in a common superclass <code>PublishedMaterial</code>.</p>
