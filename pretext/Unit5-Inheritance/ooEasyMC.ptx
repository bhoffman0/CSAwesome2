      <p>What best describes the purpose of a class’s constructor?</p>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            A constructor is often used to initialize the fields to their
            default values or in the case of a parameterized constructor, to the
            values passed in to the constructor.

            Determines the amount of space needed for an object and creates the

        Under which of these conditions is it appropriate to overload a method
        (ie: the class will contain two methods with the same name)?

    </statement>

    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>The methods do different things.</p>

          <p>Methods that do different things should be named differently.</p>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>The methods have different parameter names.</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            There is no reason the parameter names ought to be different if the
            two methods are performing the same action.
          </p>
        </feedback>

      <choice>

          <p>The methods have different post-conditions.</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            If the methods have different post-conditions, they are performing
            different functions, and should be named differently.
          </p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Two methods with the same name can never be included in the same
            class.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            If two methods perform the same function, they can be named the
            same. However, the number of parameters, type of parameters, or
            order of parameter types must be different.

          <p>The methods have different numbers of parameters</p>
        </statement>

        <feedback>
          <p>
            Overloading occurs when two methods perform the same essential
            operation, but take a different number and/or type of parameters.

        A car dealership needs a program to store information about the cars for
        sale. For each car, they want to keep track of the following
        information: number of doors (2 or 4), whether the car has air
        conditioning, and its average number of miles per gallon. Which of the
        following is the best design?

            Only <code>Car </code> should be a class. The number of doors, flag
            if it has air conditioning, and the average number of miles per
            gallon are attributes of a car so they belong in a <code>Car </code>

            Doors, air conditioning, and miles per gallon are not a kind of car.

            The number of doors, flag if it has air conditioning, and the

            A door is not a type of car. A flag for air conditioning is not a
            type of door, and a miles per gallon is not a type of air
            conditioning flag. Child classes need to be able to be substituted
            for the parent class.

            A class <code>Car </code> can't be a subclass of three different
            classes. Each class can only have one parent class. Also a car is
            not a type of door, air conditioning flag, or miles per gallon.

            Only the programmer of the <code>Employee </code> class must know

        A bookstore is working on an on-line ordering system. For each type of

            This will complicate the process of retrieving objects based on
            their type. Also if we need to add information that is specific to
            <code>Book </code> or <code>Movie </code> or <code>AudioTape </code>
            it would be best if these were subclasses of <code>PublishedMaterial
            </code>.

            This involves writing more code than is necessary (usually people
            copy and paste the shared code) and makes it harder to fix errors.
            It would be better to put common fields and methods in the
            superclass <code>PublishedMaterial </code> and have <code>Book
            </code>, <code>Movie </code>, and <code>AudioTape </code> be
            subclasses.

            The class name, <code>BookStore </code>, seems to imply the thing
            that keeps track of the store. This would be an appropriate class
            name for an object that handles the items in the <code>Bookstore
            </code>. However, for the published material, it would be better to
            use a superclass <code>PublishedMaterial </code> and subclasses for
            <code>Book </code>, <code>Movie </code> and <code>AudioTape </code>.

            This is more classes than is necessary. Items such as <code>Title

            and <code>DatePublished </code> are simple variables that do not
            need a class of their own but should be fields in a
            <code>PublishedMaterial </code> superclass, with <code>Movie

            We will need to get objects based on their type so we should create
            classes for <code>Book </code>, <code>Movie </code>, and
            <code>AudioTape </code>. They have common fields so we should put
