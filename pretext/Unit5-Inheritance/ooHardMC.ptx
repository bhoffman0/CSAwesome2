            Even though b is declared as type <code>Base </code> it is created
            as an object of the <code>Derived </code> class, so all methods to
            it will be resolved starting with the <code>Derived </code> class.
            So the <code>methodOne() </code> in <code>Derived </code> will be
            called. This method first calls <code>super.methodOne </code> so
            this will invoke the method in the superclass (which is <code>Base
            </code>). So next the <code>methodOne </code> in <code>Base </code>
            will execute. This prints the letter "A" and invokes
            <code>this.methodTwo() </code>. Since <code>b </code> is really a
            <code>Derived </code> object, we check there first to see if it has
            a <code>methodTwo </code>. It does, so execution continues in the
            <code>Derived </code> class <code>methodTwo </code>. This method
            invokes <code>super.methodTwo </code>. So this will invoke the
            method in the super class ( <code>Base </code>) named
            <code>methodTwo </code>. This method prints the letter "B" and then
            returns. Next the execution returns from the call to the
            <code>super.methodTwo </code> and prints the letter "D". We return
            to the <code>Base </code> class <code>methodOne </code> and return
            from that to the <code>Derived </code> class <code>methodOne </code>
            and print the letter "C".

            This would be true if the object was created of type <code>Base
            </code>. But the object is really a <code>Derived </code> object. So
            all methods are looked for starting with the <code>Derived </code>
            class.

            After the call to <code>methodOne </code> in the super class
            printing "A", the code continues with the implicit
            <code>this.methodTwo </code> which resolves from the current
            object's class which is <code>Derived </code>. Next, <code>methodTwo
            </code> in the <code>Derived </code> class is executed which then
            calls <code>super.methodTwo </code> which invokes <code>println
            </code> "B" from <code>methodTwo </code> in the <code>Base </code>
            class. Then the "D" in the <code>Derived </code> <code>methodTwo
            </code> is printed. Finally the program returns to <code>methodOne
            </code> in the <code>Derived </code> class are prints "C".

            The call to <code>methodTwo </code> in <code>super.methodOne </code>
            is to <code>this.methodTwo </code> which is the method from the
            <code>Derived </code> class. Consequently the "D" is also printed.

            <code>Point2D </code> does have a constructor that takes an <code>x
            </code> and <code>y </code> value so this is okay. Also the call to
            super is the first line of code in the child constructor as
            required. However, both I and III are okay as well.

          <p>
            The <code>x </code> and <code>y </code> values in <code>Point2D
            </code> are public and so can be directly accessed by all classes
            including subclasses. Also there is a no-arg constructor in
            <code>Point2D </code> so the super no-arg constructor will be called
            before the first line of code in this constructor.

            I is true because <code>Point2D </code> does have a no-arg
            constructor. II is true because <code>Point2D </code> does have a
            constructor that takes <code>x </code> and <code>y </code>. III is
            true because <code>Point2D </code> does have a no-arg constructor
            which will be called before the first line of code is executed in
            this constructor. The fields <code>x </code> and <code>y </code> are
            public in <code>Point2D </code> and thus can be directly accessed by
            all classes.

            This would be true if <code>x </code> and <code>y </code> were
            private in <code>Point2D </code>, but they are public.

            <code>Point2D </code> does have a no-arg constructor and since the
            constructor in <code>Point3D </code> doesn't have an explicit call
            to super as the first line of code in the constructor one will be
            added for the no-arg constructor. However, both II and III are okay
            as well.
