  <title>is-a vs. has-a (Day 2)</title>
  <introduction>
    <p xml:id="UNIQUE-ID-000903">Another type of relationship between classes is the <term>has-a</term> relationship or <term>association</term> relationship.  Use this when the object of one class contains a reference to one or more of another class.  For example, a course can have many course periods associated with it as shown below.  The <c>1</c> near the <c>Course</c> means that <c>1</c> course object is associated with the number shown near the other class.  In this case it is <c>*</c> which means 0 to many.  So one course is associated with 0 to many course periods.</p>

    <p>In the code, the <c>Course</c> class <term>has</term> an array or ArrayList of <c>CoursePeriod</c> objects as an attribute inside it.</p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
public class Course
{
    private ArrayList&lt;CoursePeriod&gt; periodList;
}
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Alternatively, we could say that a CoursePeriod  has a Course attribute inside it to hold the information about the Course. It is up to the programmer how to design these two classes depending on which type of association would be more useful in the program.</p>
    <program language="java">
      <input>
public class CoursePeriod
{
    private Course courseInfo;
    private int period;
}
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Here is another example. Consider the classes Student, Course, and  APcourse. An APcourse is a special type of Course. Students are in Courses. What are the relationships between these classes? The UML diagram below shows the inherits (is-a) relationship between Course and APcourse and the associate (has-a) relationship between Course and Students.</p>

    <p>We can represent the diagram in Figure 4 in the code below. The Course class has an ArrayList of Student objects in it as the roster attribute. And an APcourse extends Course. What do you think the following code will print out?</p>

    <title>is-a Substitution Test</title>
    <p>If you aren&#x2019;t sure if a class should inherit from another class ask yourself if you can substitute the subclass type for the superclass type.  For example, if you have a <c>Book</c> class and it has a subclass of <c>ComicBook</c> does that make sense?  Is a comic book a kind of book?  Yes, a comic book is a kind of book so inheritance makes sense.  If it doesn&#x2019;t make sense use <em>association</em> or the <em>has-a</em> relationship instead.</p>
    <note>
      <p>Only use inheritance when the child class is really a type of the parent class, otherwise use association.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>9-1-6:  An online store is working on an online ordering system for Books and Movies. For each type of Published Material (books and movies) they need to track the id, title, date published, and price. Which of the following would be the best design?</p>
      </statement>
      <choices>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>Create one class PublishedMaterial with the requested attributes.</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>This will complicate the process of retrieving objects based on their type. Also if we need to add information that is specific to Book or Movie, it would be best if these were subclasses of PublishedMaterial.</p>
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>Create classes Book and Movie and each class has the requested attributes.</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>This involves writing more code than is necessary (usually people copy and paste the shared code) and makes it harder to fix errors. It would be better to put common attributes and methods in the superclass PublishedMaterial and have Book and Movie be subclasses.</p>
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement>
            <p>Create the class PublishedMaterial and have Book and Movie inherit from it all the listed attributes.</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>We will need to get objects based on their type so we should create classes for Book and Movie. They have common attributes so we should put these in a common superclass PublishedMaterial.</p>
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>Create one class BookStore with the requested attributes.</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>The class name, BookStore, seems to imply the thing that keeps track of the store. This would be an appropriate class name for an object that handles the items in the Bookstore. However, for the published material, it would be better to use a superclass PublishedMaterial and subclasses for Books and Movies.</p>
          </feedback>
        </choice>
        <choice>
          <statement>
            <p>Create classes for PublishedMaterial, Books, Movies, Title, Price, ID, Authors, DatePublished</p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>This is more classes than is necessary. Items such as Title, Price, ID, and DatePublished are simple variables that do not need a class of their own but should be attributes in a PublishedMaterial superclass, with Movies and Books as subclasses.</p>

    <p>Working in pairs or groups, design an online store with classes for Store, ItemForSale, Book, Movie, and Author.</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>First, do some research in an online store like Amazon to see what information they store on books, movies, and authors, and what type of information is the same for all items for sale.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>List at least 2 attributes for each class. Which attributes should be in ItemForSale and which in Book, Movie or Author?</p>

        <li>
          <p>What is the relationship between ItemForSale and Book? between ItemForSale and Movie? between Book and Author? between Store and ItemForSale? You may want to draw UML Class Diagrams for these classes on paper or using an online drawing tool like <url href="https://app.diagrams.net/" visual="https://app.diagrams.net/">app.diagrams.net</url> or <url href="https://creately.com" visual="https://creately.com">Creately.com</url> (choose UML Class Diagrams, click to connect classes and choose the relationship)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use the ActiveCode window below to declare each class and specify their relationship to one another with inheritance or association. (Note that usually, each public class would be in a separate file, but since we only have 1 file in Active Code, we only make 1 class public).  Only put in the instance variables for each class. We will learn how to make constructors and methods in the next lessons.</p>
