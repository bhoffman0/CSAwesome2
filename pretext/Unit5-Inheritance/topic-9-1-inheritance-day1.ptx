  <title>Inheritance (Day 1)</title><introduction>
    
    <p>One of the really useful features of Object-Oriented programming is <term>inheritance</term>.  You may have heard of someone coming into an inheritance, which often means they were left something from a relative who died.  Or, you might hear someone say that they have inherited musical ability from a parent.  In Java all classes can <term>inherit</term> attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (methods) from another class.  The class being inherited from is called the <term>parent class</term> or <term>superclass</term>.  The class that is inheriting is called the <term>child class</term> or <term>subclass</term>.</p>
    <p>When one class inherits from another, we can say that it is the <em>same kind of thing</em> as the <term>parent class</term> (the class it inherits from).  For example, a car is a kind of vehicle.  This is sometimes called the <em>is-a</em> relationship, but more accurately it’s a <em>is-a kind of</em> relationship.  A motorcycle is another kind of vehicle.  All vehicles have a make, model, and year that they were created.  All vehicles can go forward, backward, turn left and turn right.</p>

    <p>A <term>UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram</term> shows classes and the relationships between the classes as seen in Figure 1.  An open triangle points to the parent class.  The parent class for <c>Car</c> and <c>Motorcycle</c> is <c>Vehicle</c>. The <c>Vehicle</c> class has two child classes or subclasses: <c>Car</c> and <c>Motorcycle</c>.</p>

            <title>Subclass extends Superclass</title>
            <p>To make a subclass inherit from a superclass, use the Java keyword <term>extends</term> with the superclass name when creating a new subclass as shown below.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
public class Car extends Vehicle
public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle
</input></program>
            
            
            <note>
                <p>While a person can have two parents, a Java class can only inherit from one parent class.  If you leave off the <term>extends</term> keyword when you declare a class then the class will inherit from the <c>Object</c> class that is already defined in Java.</p>

  <subsection>
            <title>Why Use Inheritance?</title>
            
            
            <p>Inheritance allows you to reuse data and behavior from the parent class.  If you notice that several classes share the same data and/or behavior,  you can pull that out into a parent class.  This is called <term>generalization</term>. For example,  Customers and Employees are both people so it makes sense use the general Person class as seen below.</p>
            <p>Inheritance is also useful for <term>specialization</term> which is when you want most of the behavior of a parent class, but want to do at least one thing differently and/or add more data.  The example below can also be seen as specialization.  An employee is a person but also has a unique id.  A customer is a person, but also has a credit card.</p>
