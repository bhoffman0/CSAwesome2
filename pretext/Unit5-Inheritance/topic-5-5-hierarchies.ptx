  <title>Inheritance Hierarchies</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      If you have multiple subclasses that inherit from a superclass, you can
      form an <term>inheritance hierarchy</term>. Every subclass is-a or is a
      kind of the superclass. For example, here is an inheritance hierarchy of
      Shapes. Square is-a Rectangle and a subclass of Rectangle. Rectangle is-a
      Shape and a subclass of Shape. In Java, the class <term>Object</term> is
      at the top of hierarchy. Every class in Java inherits from Object and
      is-an Object.
    </p>

      <caption>An Inheritance Hierarchy of Shapes</caption>
      <image source="Unit5-Inheritance/Figures/shapes.png" width="71%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      One of the main reasons to use an inheritance hierarchy is that all the
      classes in the hierarchy can be treated as instances of the top type in
      the hierarchy. This is called <term>polymorphism</term> and we’ll discuss
      it in more detail in the next section.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inheritance can also reduce code duplication since common behaviors can be
      defined in methods in a superclass and inherited by all their subclasses.
      But you should never use inheritance just to reuse code if there isn’t a
      true “is-a” relationship between the subclass and the superclass.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="superclass-references">
    <title>Superclass References</title>
    <p>
      A superclass reference variable can hold an object of that superclass or
      of any of its subclasses. For example, a Shape reference variable can hold
      a Rectangle or Square object. (This is a type of <term>polymorphism</term>
      which will be defined in the next lesson).
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// The variables declared of type Shape can hold objects of its subclasses
Shape s1 = new Shape();
Shape s2 = new Rectangle();
Shape s3 = new Square();
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Notice that the opposite is not true. You cannot declare a variable of the
      subclass and put in a superclass object. For example, a Square reference
      cannot hold a Shape object because not all Shapes are Squares. The code
      below will give an “Incompatible types: Shape cannot be converted to
      Square” error.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// A subclass variable cannot hold the superclass object!
// A Square is-a Shape, but not all Shapes are Squares.
// Square q = new Shape(); // ERROR!!
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Why is using a superclass reference for subclass objects useful? Because
      now, we can write methods with parameters of type Shape or have arrays of
      type Shape and use them with any of its subclasses as seen in the next
      sections.

  <subsection xml:id="superclass-method-parameters">
    <title>Superclass Method Parameters</title>
    <p>
      Another advantage of an inheritance hierarchy is that we can write methods
      with parameters of the superclass type and pass in subclass objects to
      them. For example, the print(Shape) method below could be called with many
      different Shape subclasses and work for Rectangles, Squares, etc.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// This will work with all Shape subclasses (Squares, Rectangles, etc.) too
public void print(Shape s)
{
   ...
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Notice that in the following code, the print method has a parameter of
      type <c>Person</c>, but it can be called with <c>Student</c> or
      <c>Person</c> objects in the <c>main</c> method. Which <c>toString</c>
      method is called? It depends on whether a <c>Person</c> or <c>Student</c>
      is passed in at runtime. What would happen if you commented out the
      <c>toString</c> method in <c>Student</c>? Which one would be called now?

    <title>Superclass Arrays and ArrayLists</title>
    <p>
      Using inheritance hierarchies, we can create arrays and <c>ArrayLists</c>
      using the superclass type and put in values that are of the subclass
      types. This can be very useful! For example, here is some code that
      creates a <c>Shape[]</c> array and an <c>ArrayList&lt;Shape&gt;</c>, both
      of which can hold any objects of <c>Shape</c> and any of its subclasses.

// This shape array can hold the subclass objects too
Shape[] shapeArray = { new Rectangle(), new Square(), new Shape() };

// The shape ArrayList can add subclass objects too
ArrayList&lt;Shape&gt; shapeList = new ArrayList&lt;Shape&gt;();
shapeList.add(new Shape());
shapeList.add(new Rectangle());
shapeList.add(new Square());
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      The code below has an <c>ArrayList&lt;Pet&gt;</c> that can hold <c>Pet</c>
      or <c>Dog</c> objects. Notice that the loop works with a variable of type

              subclasses can be stored in the same array when the array is

      The following code contains a class called ShoppingCart that simulates a

          <p>
            An <term>inheritance hierarchy</term> of subclasses inheriting from
            superclasses can be formed with Object being the top of the
            hierarchy.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            When a class S “is-a” class T, T is referred to as a superclass, and
            S is referred to as a subclass.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If S is a subclass of T, then a reference of type T can be used to
            refer to an object of type T or S. This is called polymorphism,
            defined more in the next lesson.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Declaring references of type T, when S is a subclass of T, is useful
            in the declaring formal method parameters of type T, arrays of type
            T[], and ArrayList&lt;T&gt; of type T so that all the subclasses of
            T can also be used with these.
