  <title>Inheritance, Superclass, Subclass</title><introduction>
    
    <p>One of the really useful features of Object-Oriented programming is <term>inheritance</term>.  You may have heard of someone coming into an inheritance, which often means they were left something from a relative who died.  Or, you might hear someone say that they have inherited musical ability from a parent.  In Java all classes can <term>inherit</term> attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (methods) from another class.  The class being inherited from is called the <term>parent class</term> or <term>superclass</term>.  The class that is inheriting is called the <term>child class</term> or <term>subclass</term>.</p>
    <p>When one class inherits from another, we can say that it is the <em>same kind of thing</em> as the <term>parent class</term> (the class it inherits from).  For example, a car is a kind of vehicle.  This is sometimes called the <em>is-a</em> relationship, but more accurately it’s a <em>is-a kind of</em> relationship.  A motorcycle is another kind of vehicle.  All vehicles have a make, model, and year that they were created.  All vehicles can go forward, backward, turn left and turn right.</p>

    <p>A <term>UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram</term> shows classes and the relationships between the classes as seen in Figure 1.  An open triangle points to the parent class.  The parent class for <c>Car</c> and <c>Motorcycle</c> is <c>Vehicle</c>. The <c>Vehicle</c> class has two child classes or subclasses: <c>Car</c> and <c>Motorcycle</c>.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="subclass-extends-superclass">
            <title>Subclass extends Superclass</title>
            <p>To make a subclass inherit from a superclass, use the Java keyword <term>extends</term> with the superclass name when creating a new subclass as shown below.</p>
            <program language="java"><code>
public class Car extends Vehicle
public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle
</code></program>
            <idx>extends</idx>

            
            <note>
                <p>While a person can have two parents, a Java class can only inherit from one parent class.  If you leave off the <term>extends</term> keyword when you declare a class then the class will inherit from the <c>Object</c> class that is already defined in Java.</p>

            <title>Why Use Inheritance?</title>
            <idx>generalization</idx>
 <idx>specialization</idx>

            
            <p>Inheritance allows you to reuse data and behavior from the parent class.  If you notice that several classes share the same data and/or behavior,  you can pull that out into a parent class.  This is called <term>generalization</term>. For example,  Customers and Employees are both people so it makes sense use the general Person class as seen below.</p>
            <p>Inheritance is also useful for <term>specialization</term> which is when you want most of the behavior of a parent class, but want to do at least one thing differently and/or add more data.  The example below can also be seen as specialization.  An employee is a person but also has a unique id.  A customer is a person, but also has a credit card.</p>

            <p>Another type of relationship between classes is the <term>has-a</term> relationship or <term>association</term> relationship.  Use this when the object of one class contains a reference to one or more of another class.  For example, a course can have many course periods associated with it as shown below.  The <c>1</c> near the <c>Course</c> means that <c>1</c> course object is associated with the number shown near the other class.  In this case it is <c>*</c> which means 0 to many.  So one course is associated with 0 to many course periods.</p>
            <figure align="center"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">A UML Class Diagram showing Association</caption><image source="Unit5-Inheritance/Figures/assoc.png" width="54%"/></figure>
            <p>In the code, the <c>Course</c> class <term>has</term> an array or ArrayList of <c>CoursePeriod</c> objects as an attribute inside it.</p>
            <program language="java"><code>
public class Course
{
    private ArrayList&lt;CoursePeriod&gt; periodList;
}
</code></program>
            <p>Alternatively, we could say that a CoursePeriod  has a Course attribute inside it to hold the information about the Course. It is up to the programmer how to design these two classes depending on which type of association would be more useful in the program.</p>
            <program language="java"><code>
public class CoursePeriod
{
    private Course courseInfo;
    private int period;
}
</code></program>
            <p>Here is another example. Consider the classes Student, Course, and  APcourse. An APcourse is a special type of Course. Students are in Courses. What are the relationships between these classes? The UML diagram below shows the inherits (is-a) relationship between Course and APcourse and the associate (has-a) relationship between Course and Students.</p>
            <figure align="center"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">A UML Class Diagram for Student, Course, APcourse</caption><image source="Unit5-Inheritance/Figures/APcourseUML.png" width="63%"/></figure>

            <title>is-a Substitution Test</title>
            <p>If you aren’t sure if a class should inherit from another class ask yourself if you can substitute the subclass type for the superclass type.  For example, if you have a <c>Book</c> class and it has a subclass of <c>ComicBook</c> does that make sense?  Is a comic book a kind of book?  Yes, a comic book is a kind of book so inheritance makes sense.  If it doesn’t make sense use <em>association</em> or the <em>has-a</em> relationship instead.</p>
            <note>
                <p>Only use inheritance when the child class is really a type of the parent class, otherwise use association.</p>

            <p>Working in pairs or groups, design an online store with classes for Store, ItemForSale, Book, Movie, and Author.</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>First, do some research in an online store like Amazon to see what information they store on books, movies, and authors, and what type of information is the same for all items for sale.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>List at least 2 attributes for each class. Which attributes should be in ItemForSale and which in Book, Movie or Author?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What is the relationship between ItemForSale and Book? between ItemForSale and Movie? between Book and Author? between Store and ItemForSale? You may want to draw UML Class Diagrams for these classes on paper or using an online drawing tool like <url href="https://app.diagrams.net/" visual="https://app.diagrams.net/">app.diagrams.net</url> or <url href="https://creately.com" visual="https://creately.com">Creately.com</url> (choose UML Class Diagrams, click to connect classes and choose the relationship)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use the ActiveCode window below to declare each class and specify their relationship to one another with inheritance or association. (Note that usually, each public class would be in a separate file, but since we only have 1 file in Active Code, we only make 1 class public).  Only put in the instance variables for each class. We will learn how to make constructors and methods in the next lessons.</p>
