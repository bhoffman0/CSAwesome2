    <idx>casting</idx>
    <idx>type casting</idx>
    <p>
      In Java, <term>type casting</term> is used to convert values from one type
      to another. By <term>casting</term> we don’t mean something to do with
      fishing, but it is a similar idea to casting a bronze, without needing to
      heat anything to 913 degrees Celsius. But like molten bronze is reshaped
      by melting it and pouring it into a mold, our data is reshaped via a
      <term>cast</term> operator. In Java when you cast you are changing the
      “shape” (or type) of the value.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Bronze casting changes the shape of the metal.</caption>
      <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/bronze-casting.jpg" width="54%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      The <term>cast operator</term>, which looks like <c>(int)</c> and
      <c>(double)</c> placed before any expression (a literal, a number, a
      variable, or more complex expression in parentheses) produces a value of
      the given type by converting the value of the original expression to the
      new type. The casting operators <c>(int)</c> and <c>(double)</c> can be
      used to convert from a double value to an int value (or vice versa). For
      example, <c>(double) 1 / 3</c> will evaluate to a <c>double</c> value
      <c>0.33333333</c> instead of an <c>int</c> truncated value <c>0</c>. And
      <c>(int) 3.6</c> will evaluate to an <c>int</c> value <c>3</c> instead of
      a <c>double</c>. Casting an <c>int</c> value to a <c>double</c> adds on
      digits to the right of the decimal point. And casting <c>double</c> value
      to an <c>int</c> value causes the digits to the right of the decimal point
      to be truncated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Run this code to find how Java handles division and what casting can do to
      the results. Notice what happens when you divide an <c>int</c> by an
      <c>int</c> or an <c>int</c> by a <c>double</c> or an <c>int</c> cast to a
      <c>double</c> divided by an <c>int</c>.

          What happens when you divide an int by an int or with a double operand
          or with the type cast (double) or (int) on one of the operands? Add
          another line that divides 5 by 2 using a (double) cast. What is the
          result?

    <p>
      When Java divides two <c>int</c>s, it produces an <c>int</c> result by
      truncating the actual mathematical result, removing anything after the
      decimal point. Thus <c>9 / 10</c> evaluates to <c>0</c>, not <c>0.9</c>.
      It also does not evaluate to <c>1</c>; truncating is not the same as
      rounding!
    </p>

    <p>
      But in any expression involving a <c>double</c>, the <c>double</c> is
      “contagious” and will cause the value of that expression to also be a
      <c>double</c>. Thus the expression <c>9.0 / 10</c> is evaluated as if it
      had been written <c>9.0 / 10.0</c> and produces the <c>double</c> value
      <c>0.9</c>. This code causes int values like 10 to be automatically cast
      (widened) to double values like 10.0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Casting an <c>int</c> to <c>double</c>, as shown in the code above,
      produces a <c>double</c> value which will then causes any expression it is
      part of to produce a <c>double</c>. This is especially useful when you
      have <c>int</c> variables that you want to do non-integer division with:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
int total; // a variable containing the sum of a bunch of ints
int count; // the number of ints that went into total

// Compute the average of the bunch of ints summed into total.
double average = (double) total / count;
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      A conversion from <c>int</c> to <c>double</c> is called a <term>widening
      conversion</term> because a <c>double</c> can represent any <c>int</c>
      value but not vice versa; thus a <c>double</c> is considered a wider data
      type than an <c>int</c>.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        <c>int</c>s in Java are always 32-bit signed values which mean they can
        represent values from <m>-2^{31}</m> to <m>2^{31} - 1</m>, inclusive,
        while the range of consecutive integer values that can be represented by
        a double is from <m>-2^{53}</m> to <m>2^{53}</m>, inclusive. (A
        <c>double</c> can also represent much larger values but with limited
        precision.) You can refer to the minimum and maximum <c>int</c> values
        with the constants <c>Integer.MIN_VALUE</c> and
        <c>Integer.MAX_VALUE</c>.

    <p>
      Values of type <c>double</c> in the range that can be represented by an
      <c>int</c> can be rounded to the nearest <c>int</c> by adding or
      subtracting 0.5 and then casting the result with <c>(int)</c>:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
double number;    // positive value from somewhere
double negNumber; // negative value from somewhere

int nearestInt = (int)(number + 0.5);
int nearestNegInt = (int)(negNumber – 0.5);
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      For example, if you divide <c>7.0 / 4.0</c> you get <c>1.75</c>. If you
      cast that to an <c>int</c>, it will be truncated to <c>1</c>. However if
      we want to round a <c>double</c> rather than truncating it, adding
      <c>0.5</c> will produce a number that is above the next integer value if
      the decimal part is greater than <c>0.5</c>, as it is here. Then casting
      <em>that</em> value to an <c>int</c> will truncate down. So in this case
      <c>1.75 + 0.5</c> gives us <c>2.25</c> which is then truncated to
      <c>2</c>. On the other hand adding <c>0.5</c> to the result of evaluating
      <c>5.0 / 4.2</c>, namely <c>1.25</c>, only gets us to <c>1.75</c> which
      truncates back to <c>1</c> which is the nearest integer to <c>1.25</c>.

    <p>
      What happens to repeating decimal numbers like 3.333333…? Such numbers
      can’t be represented exactly in any finite number of digits so computers
      have to store an approximation. Java’s <c>double</c>s can store about
      14-15 digits worth of precision which is plenty for most purposes but you
      should be aware that the accuracy of any calculation on a computer is
      limited by the fact that computers can only hold a limited number of
      digits.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, int values are stored in 4 bytes of memory. The constant
      <c>Integer.MAX_VALUE</c> holds the value of the largest possible int value
      in Java which is 2147483647, and <c>Integer.MIN_VALUE</c> holds the
      smallest int value -2147483648. Values in an <c>int</c> variable must be
      within the range of <c>Integer.MIN_VALUE</c> and <c>Integer.MAX_VALUE</c>
      inclusively. If you try to store any number larger or smaller than these
      numbers in an <c>int</c> variable, it will result in an <term>integer
      overflow</term> where an incorrect value could be stored. Try it below.

      Computers allot a specified amount of memory to store data based on the
      data type. For <c>double</c> values, computers allot twice as much memory
      than for <c>int</c>s—8 bytes rather than 4. However it’s still possible
      that an expression would evaluate to a mathematical value that requires
      more precision than can be stored in even 8 bytes. In that case a round-
      off error occurs and the result is rounded to the nearest <c>double</c>
      representable in 8 bytes. For example, repeating decimals like
      0.333333333333333333 will be cut off after about 15 digits. To avoid
      round-off errors, you can choose to round the result to a specified number
      of digits after the decimal point or to an <c>int</c> value.

      Although it’s not on the AP exam, you can format long decimal numbers to
      just show 2 digits after the decimal point with the following code using
      <c>printf</c> a formatted print method or <c>format</c> instead of
      <c>println</c>. It takes a format string like <c>%.02f</c> which tells
      <c>printf</c> to print a floating point number indicated by the <c>%</c>
      with 2 digits after the decimal point. See <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html</url>
      for more information. You can also use escape characters like <c>\n</c> in

    <title>Bonus Challenge : Unicode</title>
    <p>
      If you get done early with the previous challenge, here’s something else
      fun you can do in Java, although it’s not covered in the AP exam.
    </p>

    <p>
      Java was one of the first programming languages to use <url
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters"
      visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters">UNICODE</url>
      for its characters rather than ASCII. While ASCII could represent 128
      characters which was plenty for English, Unicode is an international
      standard that tries to assign a number (which they like to call a
      “codepoint”) to every character in every language. Unicode codepoints are
      traditionally represented in hex code (a base 16 code that uses the digits
      0-9 and the letters A-F for 10-15), so you might see things like
      <c>U+1F600</c>. But they’re just numbers. That last one is the same as
      <c>128512</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Java was released in an 1996, Unicode had been around for five years
      and the Unicode people had declared they would only ever need
      <m>2^{16}</m> or 65,536 code points to represent all the characters used
      in the world. So Java included a <c>char</c> data type that can hold
      exactly <m>2^{16}</m> values. Then, seven months later, the Unicode folks,
      said, “Ooops, that’s not enough”, and extended their system to its current
      size of 1,112,064 possible codepoints. (As of September 2024, 154,998
      codepoints have actually been assigned characters.)
    </p>

    <p>
      That made <c>char</c> kind of obsolete. But while not every Unicode
      codepoint can be represented in a Java <c>char</c>, you can use an
      <c>int</c> to represent a codepoint and the method
      <c>Character.toString</c> to translate an <c>int</c> into a <c>String</c>
      containing the character for that codepoint. (You might see older Java
      code that casts numbers to <c>char</c>; for many codepoints that will work
      but not on more recently added codepoints including, critically those for
      Emoji. 😞 So better to use <c>Character.toString</c> and ignore
      <c>char</c>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Try the following program which prints out an English “A”, a <url
      href="https://unicodelookup.com/#cjk/1"
      visual="https://unicodelookup.com/#cjk/1">Chinese character</url>, and an
      <url href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html"
      visual="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji</url>.
      Then look up other characters at this <url
      href="https://unicodelookup.com/"
      visual="https://unicodelookup.com/">Unicode Lookup</url> site and change
      the code to print them out. (Use the Dec column in site to get the decimal
      number.) Can you print out letters from 3 different languages?

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Type casting</term> is used to convert a value from one type
            to another.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.A.1) The casting operators <c>(int)</c> and <c>(double)</c>
            can be used to convert from a double value to an int value (or vice
            versa).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.A.2) Casting a <c>double</c> value to an <c>int</c> causes
            the digits to the right of the decimal point to be truncated (cut
            off and thrown away).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.A.3) Some code causes int values to be automatically cast
            (widened) to double values. In expressions involving <c>double</c>s,
            the <c>double</c> values are contagious, causing <c>int</c>s in the
            expression to be automatically converted (“widened”) to the
            equivalent <c>double</c> value so the result of the expression can
            be computed as a <c>double</c>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.A.4) Values of type <c>double</c> can be rounded to the
            nearest integer by (int)(x + 0.5) or (int)(x – 0.5) for negative
            numbers.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.B.1) The constant <c>Integer.MAX_VALUE</c> holds the value
            of the largest possible int value. The constant
            <c>Integer.MIN_VALUE</c> holds the value of the smallest possible
            int value.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.B.2) Integer values in Java are represented by values of
            type <c>int</c>, which are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of
            memory. Therefore, an int value must be in the range from
            <c>Integer.MIN_VALUE</c> to <c>Integer.MAX_VALUE</c>, inclusive.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.B.3) If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside
            of the allowed range, an <term>integer overflow</term> occurs. The
            result is an int value in the allowed range but not necessarily the
            value expected.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 1.5.C.1) Computers allot a specified amount of memory to store
            data based on the data type. If an expression would evaluate to a
            double that is more precise than can be stored in the allotted
            amount of memory, a <term>round-off error</term> occurs. The result
            will be rounded to the representable value. To avoid rounding errors
            that naturally occur, use int values or round doubles to the
            precision needed.
