      Earlier in this book, we used code like <c>System.out.println("hello,
      world!")</c> to print to the screen. When we include that code in a
      program, we don’t have to worry about exactly how it works; we just need
      to know what it does. Namely, it causes the text “hello, world!” to appear
      on the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      A collection of code written by other programmers that we can use 
      is called a <term>library</term> and the details of how to use a library
      are described in its <term>Application Programming Interface</term>, or
      <term>API</term> for short. <c>System.out.println()</c> is part of the
      Java API, a large set of code that comes with Java.
    </p>

    <p>
      APIs and libraries are essential to programming because they allow us to
      focus on the specific task we are trying to accomplish without having to
      rewrite the same bits of functionality over and over.

    <title>The Turtle Library: Classes, Attributes, and Behaviors</title>

    <p>
      One of the great things about Java is the number of libraries
      written by other programmers that we can use. One such library is the 
      <c>Turtle</c> Java library, written by one of the author’s of this book,
      Dr. Barbara Ericson and built into this e-book. It allows us to create
      drawings using animated turtles that move around the screen. 
      Try clicking run below to see a turtle in action.
    </p>

      <program interactive="activecode" language="java" datafile="turtleClasses.jar,turtleClasses2.jar">
        <code>
import java.awt.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TurtleTest
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Do not change the next 2 lines
        World habitat = new World(300, 300);
        Turtle yertle = new Turtle(habitat);

        // Code to make yertle move forward and turn right
        yertle.forward();
        yertle.turnRight();
        
        habitat.show(true);
    }
}
        </code>
      </program>

    <p>
      The Turtle library is named after its main <term>class</term>, <c>Turtle</c>. 
      A <term>class</term> defines a specific reference type and is the building block of object-oriented programming.  
      You'll write your own classes in Unit 3, but in this unit,
      we just want to focus on using classes that other programmers have
      written.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each class defines a new kind of value similar to how each primitive
      type like <c>int</c> or <c>double</c> define a
      particular kind of value, such as a 32-bit integer quantity for an
      <c>int</c> or a 64-bit floating point value for a <c>double</c>. These new
      kinds of values, defined by classes, are called <term>objects</term> which
      is where <term>object-oriented programming</term> gets its name. 
      Existing classes like <c>Turtle</c> can be utilized to create Turtle objects like <c>yertle</c> that can move
      around the screen, drawing lines. We will learn more about classes and objects in lesson 1.12.
    </p>

    <p>
      Classes define the structure of objects in terms of
      <term>attributes</term> and <term>behaviors</term>. 
      <term>Attributes</term> refer to the data related to the class and are stored in variables.
      <term>Behaviors</term> refer to what instances of the class can do (or what can be done 
      with them) and are defined by methods.
      The following picture of a turtle shows some of the attributes every
    <c>Turtle</c> object has, such as a <c>color</c>, <c>xPos</c>,
      <c>yPos</c>, and <c>heading</c> as well as behaviors implemented as methods like <c>forward()</c>,
      <c>backward()</c>, <c>turnLeft()</c>, and <c>turnRight()</c> shown in the
      picture written around the turtle.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Turtle Attributes and Behaviors</caption>
      <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/turtleOOD.svg" width="50%" alt="Turtle attributes and behaviors" />
    </figure>

    

    <p>
      The Java program in the exercise
      above creates a <c>Turtle</c> object and stores a reference to it in
      the variable <c>yertle</c>. The following two lines of code are used to
      tell the turtle to move forward and then turn right.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
yertle.forward();
yertle.turnRight();
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      The period (<c>.</c>) after <c>yertle</c> in both those lines is called
      the <term>dot operator</term> and it allows us to access the attributes
      and methods of an object. In the first line the dot says get the method
      named <c>forward()</c> defined in the <c>Turtle</c> class and call it on the
      turtle object named by the variable <c>yertle</c>. The exact behavior of
      the method will depend on the current values of <c>yertle</c>’s attributes
      such as its color, its x and y position, and its heading. For instance,
      calling <c>forward()</c> will cause the turtle to draw a line from its
      current x and y position to a new position 100 pixels away in whatever
      direction the turtle is facing and the color of the line will be
      determined by the turtle’s color.
    </p>

   <p><term>Documentation</term> found in API specifications and libraries
      is essential to understanding the attributes and behaviors of a
      class defined by the API. Here’s the API documentation that lists all of the Turtle methods found in 
      <url
      href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/CSE11/turtleClassesDocs/index.html?turtleClasses/SimpleTurtle.html">the
      Turtle Javadocs</url>.

            The following program uses a turtle to draw a sideways capital L as
            seen in the image, but the lines are mixed up. The program should do
            all necessary set-up. Then it should ask the turtle to turn right,
            go forward, turn left, and then go forward 50 pixels. Next, it
            should ask the habitat to show itself. Drag the needed blocks of
            statements from the left column to the right column and put them in

    <title>Packages</title>

    <p>
      While classes are the main building blocks of Java programs, most programs
      and libraries are made up of multiple classes that need to be used
      together. In Java, related classes can be grouped together into a
      <term>package</term>. You can think of a package like a folder where you
      store related documents. Classes that work together will likely be
      grouped into a single package just to keep things organized. But more
      importantly, when we want to use a class defined in a package in our own
      program, we can <term>import</term> it and then use it as if we had written
      it in our own program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because related classes are usually collected into the same package, Java
      programmers tend to use the terms <term>library</term>, <term>API</term>,
      and <term>package</term> somewhat interchangeably. But to be precise, a
      library is a collection of classes written by other programmers that you can use, 
      the library’s API describes how you use it, and the classes in the library are probably
      organized into one or more Java packages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later on, we will learn to <c>import</c> classes from Java packages to use
      in our code, but first let’s talk about a package whose classes are always
      available in any Java program: <c>java.lang</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <c>java.lang</c> package contains key classes that are fundamental to
      the Java programming language, such as <c>String</c> and <c>System</c>.
      Like all packages that are part of Java, <c>java.lang</c> is documented in
      <term>Javadocs</term>, Java’s version of online <term>API
      documentation</term>. Learning to read and navigate Javadocs is a key part
      of being a Java programmer.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The Javadocs for a class will document all the publicly available
      attributes (called <term>fields</term> in Javadocs) and behaviors (called
      <term>methods</term>). How can you tell fields and methods apart when you
      look at library documentation? Well, for one thing, they’re in different
      sections. And another easy way is that methods will always have
      parentheses after them, for example <c>forward()</c> or <c>println()</c>.
      Sometimes there’s nothing between the parentheses, but they are still
      necessary. Other times they contain data that the method needs to do its
      job, for example what to print. Since attributes, a.k.a. fields, are just
      variables they will not have parentheses after the name.
    </p>

    <activity label="count-println">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now let’s practice reading Javadocs to better understand the code
          we’ve been using to print to the screen: <c>System.out.println</c>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take a look at the <url
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/package-summary.html">Javadocs
          for the <c>java.lang</c> package</url>. Can you find the documentation
          for the <c>System</c> class? The dot after <c>System</c> is the dot
          operator and since the name after the dot, <c>out</c> isn’t followed
          by parenthesis it must be a field rather than a method. See if you can
          find the documentation for the field <c>out</c> in the <c>System</c>
          class. That should tell you that it is an instance of the class
          <c>PrintStream</c>. From there you can click on <c>PrintStream</c> to
          navigate to the <url
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html">Javadocs</url>
          for that class. Once you’re there, see if you can find the
          documentation for the various versions of the <c>println()</c> method
          that we use to print to the screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          How many <c>println()</c> methods are documented in the <url
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html"><c>PrintStream</c>
