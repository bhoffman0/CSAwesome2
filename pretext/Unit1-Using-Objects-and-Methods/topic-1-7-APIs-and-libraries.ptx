    <p>
      We have been using the <c>System.out.println()</c> method to print to the
      screen. This method is part of the Java <term>API (Application Programming
      Interface)</term>. A <term>method</term> is a block of code that performs
      a specific task. APIs are connected to <term>libraries</term> which are
      collections of classes written by other programmers that provide a set of
      methods that can be used to perform specific tasks. An API specification
      tells the programmer how to use those classes with methods in a library.
    </p>

    <p>
      APIs and libraries are essential to programming because they allow you to
      use code that has already been written by others. This saves you time and
      allows you to focus on the specific task you are trying to accomplish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Classes in the APIs and libraries are grouped into packages. A
      <term>package</term> is a collection of related classes and interfaces
      (which are similar to classes) that can be <term>imported</term> into a
      program to be used. A package is like a folder of classes in a library’s
      file directory and is used to avoid name conflicts. Later on, we will
      learn to <c>import</c> other Java packages to use in our code, but there
      is a package that is already built into Java called <c>java.lang</c> that
      we are already using.
    </p>

    <p>
      The terms library, API, and package are often used interchangeably to mean
      similar things. A library is a collection of classes or code written by
      other programmers that you can use. An API describes how you use the
      library. And a package is how Java organizes a library to be used.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="java-lang-package">
    <title>java.lang Package</title>
    <p>
      The <c>java.lang</c> package contains built-in classes and interfaces that
      are fundamental to the Java programming language, such as the
      <c>String</c> class and the <c>System</c> class which we use in
      <c>System.out.println</c>. Take a look at the <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/package-summary.html">documentation
      for the <c>java.lang</c> package</url>. Can you find the documentation for
      the <c>System</c> class?
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Documentation</term> found in API specifications and libraries is
      essential to understanding the attributes and behaviors of a class defined
      by the API. The <c>System</c> class has an object called <c>out</c> that
      is type <c>PrintStream</c>, and the <c>PrintStream</c> class has a method
      called <c>println()</c> that we use to print to the screen. How many
      <c>println()</c> methods are there in <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html">documentation
      for the <c>PrintStream</c> class</url>? One for each type that it can
      print!

  <subsection xml:id="turtle-library">
    <title>Turtle Library</title>
    <p>
      The <c>Turtle</c> Java library, written by one of the author’s of this
      book, Dr. Barbara Ericson, allows you to create drawings using an animated
      turtle that moves around the screen. The turtle can move forward, turn,
      and draw lines. The turtle library is a collection of classes that can be
      imported into your code and is built in to this e-book.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Classes</term> are the building blocks of Java and object-oriented
      programming. A class defines a specific reference type. Programmers often
      create new classes like <c>Turtle</c> so that it can be used as a new data
      type. Classes like <c>Turtle</c> and class libraries can be utilized to
      create objects like a particular turtle named <c>yertle</c>. A class
      defines the data and behavior for all objects of that type.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following picture of a turtle shows some of the Turtle
      <term>attributes</term> like name, width, height, color in the body of the
      turtle and its <term>methods</term> like forward(), backward(), written
      around the turtle.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Turtle Attributes and Behaviors</caption>
      <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/turtleOOD.png" width="71%" alt="Turtle attributes and behaviors" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      <term>Attributes</term> (which are sometimes called <term>fields</term> in
      documentation) refer to the data related to the class and are stored in
      variables. <term>Behaviors</term> refer to what objects of the class can
      do (or what can be done with it) and are defined by methods. The
      <c>Turtle</c> class has attributes like <c>name</c>, <c>height</c>, and
      <c>width</c> that store data about the turtle, and it has
      behaviors/methods like <c>forward()</c> and <c>turnLeft()</c> that allow
      the turtle to move and turn. We will learn more about classes, objects,
      attributes, and methods in the next lessons, but this lesson introduces
      them to explore APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      How can you tell attributes and methods apart when you look at library
      documentation? One easy way is that methods will always have parentheses
      after them, for example <c>forward()</c> or <c>println()</c>. Sometimes
      these are empty, but still necessary, and sometimes they contain data that
      the method needs to do its job, for example what to print. Attributes are
      variables and will not have parentheses after them. Here’s the API
      documentation that lists all of the Turtle methods (but not the
      attributes): <url
      href="https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/doc/SimpleTurtle.html"
      visual="https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/doc/SimpleTurtle.html">https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/doc/SimpleTurtle.html</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Try the Java program below that creates a Turtle object called
      <c>yertle</c> using the Turtle class. The following code is used to tell
      the turtle to move forward and then turn right. The <term>dot
      operator</term> (.) is used to run an object’s methods, just like in the
      <c>System.out.println()</c> method. (If the code below does not work or is
      too slow in your browser, you can also see the <c>Turtle</c> code in
      action at this <url href="https://replit.com/@BerylHoffman/Java-Swing-Turtle#Main.java">replit link</url> (refresh page after forking and if it
      gets stuck) or download the files <url

          The following program uses a turtle to draw a sideways capital L as
          seen in the image, but the lines are mixed up. The program should do
          all necessary set-up. Then it should ask the turtle to turn right, go
          forward, turn left, and then go forward 50 pixels. Next, it should ask
          the habitat to show itself. Drag the needed blocks of statements from
          the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.
          There are 2 extra blocks that are not needed in a correct solution.
          Then click on Check Me to see if you are right. You will be told if
          any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.

    <title>Coding Challenge : Turtle Drawing</title>
    <p>
      Make yertle the Turtle draw a shape. For example, have it draw a square or
      a zigzag shape or a block letter by calling the forward method and a turn
      method multiple times. We encourage you to work in pairs for this
      challenge. In the next lessons, we will draw more complicated shapes. Here
      are some simple turtle methods that you could use or check the API at <url
