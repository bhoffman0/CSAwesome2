  <title>Java Swing GUIs (optional)</title>
  <p>
    If you used a language like App Inventor before this class, you are probably
    used to making a <term>User Interface</term> (UI) with buttons and other
    graphical components. Java has a library called <term>Swing</term> which is
    a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that includes buttons and other
    standard graphical components. Java Swing is not covered on the College
    Board AP exam, but it is fun to use. This lesson is an optional introduction
    to Java Swing and using its classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The graphical components in Java Swing are all classes, and to use them, you
    must declare objects of those classes. In this lesson, we will show the
    following Swing classes:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>JFrame : a window or container for the GUI.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>JButton : a button that can be clicked.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>JLabel : a label that can be used to print output to the GUI.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To use Java Swing, you usually need to import the following libraries:
  </p>

  <program language="java" datafile="turtleClasses.jar,turtleClasses2.jar">
    <code>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.swing.*;
    </code>
  </program>

  <p>
    To set up a JFrame window for your UI, declare an object of type JFrame, set
    its size in pixels, its layout, and make it visible:
  </p>

  <program language="java">
    <code>
JFrame frame = new JFrame("My app");
frame.setSize(500, 500);
frame.setLayout(null);
frame.setVisible(true); // usually at the end of the main method
    </code>
  </program>

  <p>
    Once you have a JFrame, you can create graphical objects like buttons and
    labels and add them to the JFrame. You can look up more information about
    these Java Swing Components and what methods they have. For example, here’s
    more information on the <url href="https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jbutton"
    visual="https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jbutton">JButton Class</url>.
  </p>

  <program language="java">
    <code>
JButton button1 = new JButton("Click Me!");
// if using null layout, set position and size for components
// setBounds(x position, y position, width, height)
button1.setBounds(10, 10, 100, 50);
frame.add(button1);
    </code>
  </program>

  <p>
    If you set the layout of the frame to null, you must use <c>setBounds(x
    position, y position, width, height)</c> for each component to set their
    position and size on the frame. Remember that the top left corner has the
    (x,y) coordinates (0,0). The bottom right corner coordinates are the size of
    your frame, for example (500,500). The width 100 and the height 50 are good
    sizes for most components. Some Java IDEs have GUI Visual Designers where
    you can drag and drop in and resize components.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <url href="https://replit.com" visual="https://replit.com">replit</url>,
    there is no GUI designer available, but it can display Java Swing GUIs. When
    creating a new repl, you can choose Java Swing as the file type, instead of
    just Java, to use a Java Swing UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here’s a <url
    href="https://replit.com/@BerylHoffman/JavaSwingHello#Main.java"
    visual="https://replit.com/@BerylHoffman/JavaSwingHello#Main.java">Java
    Swing Example</url> on replit that sets up a <c>JFrame</c> with a
    <c>JButton</c> and a <c>JLabel</c>. It calls a special method called
    <c>addActionListener</c> where you can put the code to be executed when you
    click on a button. Can you add another button to it? Remember that you will
    need to create a <c>JButton</c> object, call <c>setBounds</c> on it, and add
    it to the frame. Copy the <c>addActionListener</c> code and change it to
    work for your new button to say “Good Bye” instead of “hello”.
