      What do Android phones, Minecraft, and Netflix have in common? They’re all
      programmed in Java! Many of the apps you use in an Android phone or tablet
      are written in Java. If you’ve used App Inventor before, those apps are
      translated to Java before they are run on a phone or tablet. Netflix uses
      Java for some of its software too. Java is a <term>programming
      language</term> that is used worldwide to create software that we all use.

    <title>Algorithms</title>
    <p>
      <term>Algorithms</term> define step-by-step processes in order to complete
      a task or solve a problem. Algorithms are used in many areas of life, not
      just in computer science. For example, a recipe is an algorithm for
      cooking a meal. A set of directions to a friend’s house is an algorithm
      for getting there. In computer science, algorithms are used to solve
      problems and to create software. For example, an algorithm can be used to
      sort a list of numbers, to search for a word in a document, or to code a
      game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Algorithms can be used to plan and design code by writing the steps down
      in English or another language or in a diagram or in
      <term>pseudocode</term> which is writing simplified code on paper. It’s
      important to plan the algorithm step by step where each step can be
      implemented by a line of code. <term>Sequencing</term> defines an order
      for when steps in a process are completed. Steps in a process are
      completed one at a time.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>First Java Program</title>
    <p>
      Every program in Java is written as a <term>class</term>. Java is an
      <term>object-oriented language</term>, and <term>classes</term> and
      <term>objects</term> created from classes are the basic building blocks in
      object-oriented programming. We’ll learn more about classes and objects
      later in this unit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the class, there can be a <term>main method</term> that starts the
      program. A <term>method</term> is a block of code that performs a specific
      task. The main method is the entry point for the program. When you ask the
      Java run-time to <em>run</em> a class, it will always start execution in
      the main method. In other programming languages, methods are called
      functions or procedures. Here is the template for a simple Java program
      with a main method:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class MyClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Put your code here!
    }
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      In Java every open curly brace <c>{</c> must have a matched close curly
      brace <c>}</c>. These are used to start and end class definitions and
      method definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Click on the run button below to have the computer execute the <c>main</c>
      method in the following class. Then, change the code to print your name.
      Be sure to keep the starting and ending quotes <c>"</c>. Click on the run
      button to run the modified code.
    </p>

    <exercise label="printName">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Run this code to see the output below it. Then change the code to
          print your name, for example “Hi Pat!”, and run again.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
        <code>
public class MyClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hi there!");
    }
}
        </code>
        <tests>
// should pass if/when they run code
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.*;

import java.io.*;

public class RunestoneTests extends CodeTestHelper
{
    @Test
    public void testMain() throws IOException
    {
        String output = getMethodOutput("main");
        String expect = "Hi there!";
        boolean passed =
                getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", true);
        assertTrue(passed);
    }
}
        </tests>
      </program>
    </exercise>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Compiling and Running Java Programs</title>
    <p>
      Code can be written in any text editor, including the small text editor
      built into the Active Code exercises in this e-book. However, an
      <term>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</term> is often used to
      write programs because it provides tools for a programmer to write,
      compile, and run code. For this course, you can use the e-book Active Code
      exercises or the Scratch button above as your IDE to run your code. Or you
      can try other IDEs mentioned in the last unit. In other IDEs, you must
      name the file the same name as the class name with “.java” as the
      extension. All code (programs) in Java must be defined inside a class in a
      source file, and the name of the class must match the file name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computers don’t actually speak Java so we have to <term>compile</term>
      (translate) Java source files that we write into class files which is code
      that a computer can understand and run. A <term>compiler</term> checks
      your code for errors and translates your code to executable code that can
      be run. Errors detectable by the compiler need to be fixed before the
      program can be run. In this e-book, the Java code is actually being sent
      to a Java server to be compiled and run, and the errors and output are
      sent back to be shown in the web page.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Java Keywords</title>
    <p>
      <term>Keywords</term> are reserved words that have special meaning in
      Java. Keywords such as <c>public</c>, <c>class</c>, and <c>void</c> must
      be in lowercase, but class names such as <c>System</c> and <c>String</c>
      are capitalized.

    <p>
      Lines in a Java program that express a complete action such as printing
      output must end with a semicolon (<c>;</c>). Such a line is called a
      <term>statement</term>. You can think of the semicolon (<c>;</c>) in Java
      like a period (<c>.</c>) in English. The same way you use a period to end
      a sentence in English, you use a semicolon to end a statement in Java. You
      will not be penalized on the exam if you forget a needed semicolon, but
      the Java compiler is not so lenient; your program won’t compile without
      it. Note also that not <em>every</em> line ends with a semicolon; if the
      line starts a construct like an <title_reference>if</title_reference>
      statement, there is no semicolon before the opening <c>{</c> nor one after
      the closing <c>}</c>.

    <title>Syntax Errors and Debugging</title>
    <p>
      <term>Syntax errors</term> are reported to you by the compiler if your
      Java code is not correctly written. Examples of syntax errors are a
      semicolon <c>;</c> missing or if the code has a open curly brace <c>{</c>
      or open quote <c>"</c>, but no close curly brace <c>}</c> or close quote
      <c>"</c>. Informally, a syntax error is called a <term>bug</term>, and the
      process of removing errors is called <term>debugging</term>. An early
      computer science pioneer <url
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"
      visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</url>
      documented a real bug, a moth that flew into a computer in 1947!

    </figure>

    <br />
    <p>
      The compiler tries to run your code, but if your code has <term>syntax
      errors</term>, you will see error messages displayed below the code.
      Compiler error messages will tell the line number that the compiler found
      the error and the type of error. The error messages are not always easy to
      understand and sometimes the actual error is before the line that the
      compiler says is the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Watch the following video to see that all coders get bugs. Debugging is a
      normal part of coding. It can be frustrating at times, but you will get
      better at it with practice! Sometimes another pair of eyes really helps,
      so ask a friend if you get stuck or try explaining your code line by line
      to someone or even a rubber duck. <url

  <subsection>
    <title>Reading Error Messages</title>
    <p>
      In the exercise below, you should click on the run button to compile and
      run the code. Unfortunately you will find there is a syntax error in the
      code that you need to fix. Before you try to fix it, look for the error
      message below the code. This is called a <term>compile time error</term>
      because it is an error detected by the compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
      It will be a lot easier to find the problem, and other problems like it,
      if you understand how to read the error message. So let’s take a closer
      look. It will look something like this:
    </p>

    <program language="text">
      <code>
FirstClass.java:5: error: unclosed string literal
       System.out.println("Hi there!);
                          ^
1 error
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      The first line starts with the name of the file that was being compiled.
      Because you submitted your code via this web page you didn’t actually name
      the file but it was named for you to match the name of your class. Then
      there’s a colon (<c>:</c>) followed by a number. That number tells you the
      line number in the file where the compiler detected the error, in this
      case line 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      Error messages aren’t always 100% accurate about where the error actually
      is; sometimes you actually need to change something a bit earlier in the
      program and sometimes a bit later. But the line number is the best place
      to start looking.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the line number and another colon, you will find the actual error
      message. These can be kind of cryptic but you should still read it. As you
      learn more Java vocabulary they will become more meaningful but they
      almost always contain some useful clues. For instance take this error
      message: “unclosed string literal”. You may not know what a string literal
      is (yet) but “unclosed” suggests something was opened and then not closed.
      Keep that thought in mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now look at the next two lines. The very next line is just the line of
      code from your program. But below that is a very important line containing
      a single caret (<c>^</c>) positioned to point at exactly where in the line
      the Java compiler thinks the problem is. In this case it’s pointing at the
      quotation mark (<c>"</c>) before “Hi”. So it’s complaining about something
      being unclosed and it’s pointing us at a quotation mark. Usually quotation
      marks come in pairs called the open quote and the close quote, right? And
      if you look at the line of code you’ll see that there’s no closing
      quotation mark. Could that be the problem? Try adding a quotation mark and
      see if that fixes it!
    </p>

    <p>
      It is worth getting in the habit of really reading error messages. The
      people who wrote the Java compiler put in lot of work to try to make the
      error messages useful. If you read them, you’ll soon learn to recognize
      common mistakes and will get much quicker at finding your syntax errors.

      Click on the run button below to try and run the following code. What is
      wrong this time? The first error message will probably point you directly
      at the problem. But after you fix that you’ll probably get a
      <title_reference>new</title_reference> error! That happens sometimes
      because the compiler can’t even detect the second error until the first
      one is fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is another reason it’s important to read error messages. It’s very
      tempting when we see that there’s an error to jump immediately to trying
      to fix it. Arg, an error! Get rid of it! But if we don’t slow down and
      read the message in a case like this, we might not notice that we’ve
      actually fixed the first error. If we don’t notice that we fixed it, we
      might undo our change and <title_reference>unfix</title_reference> it!
    </p>

    <p>
      So read the error messages—they’re there to help you. With that in mind,
      see if you can fix both errors in this code. A hint for the second error:
      capitalization matters.

    <title>Run-time Errors</title>
    <p>
      Some errors cannot be detected by the compiler. These are called
      <term>run-time errors</term>. These errors occur when the program is
      running, after the code is compiled. They can be caused by a variety of
      things, such as dividing by zero or trying to read from a file that
      doesn’t exist or a logic error in the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      An <term>exception</term> is a type of run-time error that occurs as a
      result of an unexpected error that was not detected by the compiler. It
      interrupts the normal flow of the program’s execution. Java will sometimes
      report an exception with a message that tells you what went wrong. For
      example, if you try to divide by zero, Java will throw (report) an
      <term>ArithmeticException</term> while running. Try this out in the code
      below.
    </p>

    <exercise label="divideByZeroDemo">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following code has a run-time error. When you click on run, the
          compiler will not catch it since it is not a syntax error. The program
          will run and try to compute 3 divided by 0 which cannot be computed.
          This will cause a run-time error, and the program will report an
          <term>ArithmeticException</term>. Try it out!
        </p>
      </statement>

      <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
        <code>
public class DivideByZero
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
       System.out("It makes no sense to divide a number by zero!");
       System.out.println(3/0);
   }
}
        </code>

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.*;

import java.io.*;

public class RunestoneTests extends CodeTestHelper
{
    @Test
    public void testMain() throws IOException
    {
        String target = "DivideByZero";
        boolean passed = checkCodeContains("DivideByZero", target);
        assertTrue(passed);
    }
}
        </tests>
      </program>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Run-time errors can be difficult to find because they don’t always cause
      the program to crash. Sometimes they just cause the program to behave in
      unexpected ways because of an error in the logic. A <term>logic
      error</term> is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to
      behave incorrectly or unexpectedly causing a run-time error. For example,
      a programmer might have made a math mistake so the wrong value is
      calculated. Logic errors can be detected by testing the program with
      specific data to see if it produces the expected outcome. We’ll see an
      example of this after learning about expressions in the next lessons.

    <title>Comments</title>
    <p>
      In Java and many text-based coding languages, <c>//</c> is used to mark
      the beginning of a comment. For multi-line comments, use <c>/*</c> to
      start the comment and <c>*/</c> to end the comment. The compiler will skip
      over comments. However, it is a good idea to use comments to make notes to
      yourself and other programmers working with you. Here are some examples of
      good commenting:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
/* MyClass.java
   Programmer: My Name
   Date:
*/

int max = 10; // this keeps track of the max score

    <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/rubberduck.jpg" width="18%" alt="Rubber Duck" />
    <p>
      In this course, you are encouraged to work together in pairs to complete
      the programming challenges. Pair programming is a successful software
      development technique where two programmers work together at one computer.
      One, the driver, types in code while the other, the navigator, gives ideas
      and feedback. The two coders switch roles frequently. Another option is
      buddy programming, where two or three coders work on their own computers
      but help each other as needed. If you’re working alone, you may want to
      explain the code to a rubber duck or another toy using <url
      href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/"
      visual="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Rubber duck debugging</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working in pairs, debug the following code. Can you find all the bugs and
      get the code to run?
