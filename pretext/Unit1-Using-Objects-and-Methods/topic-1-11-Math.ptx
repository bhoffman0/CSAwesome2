      Games would be boring if the same thing happened each time you played the
      game. Random numbers can be used in games to generate different outcomes
      each time the game is played. In Java, the <c>Math.random()</c> method to
      is used to generate a random number.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of mathematical methods in the <c>Math</c> class that you
      might want to use in your programs, like <c>Math.pow(2,3)</c> which
      calculates the 2 to the power of 3 which is 8.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <c>Math</c> class is part of the <c>java.lang</c> package. Classes in
      the <c>java.lang</c> package are available by default. The <c>Math</c>
      methods are <term>class methods</term> (or <term>static</term> methods)
      which means you can call them by just using <c>ClassName.methodName()</c>.

      The <c>Math</c> class contains the following methods that are in the AP
      CSA subset. There are more <c>Math</c> methods, outside of what you need
      on the AP exam, that you can find in the <url

            (which is the value of a number without its sign, for example
            <c>Math.abs(-4)</c> = 4).

        All the <c>Math</c> methods that you may need to use or understand on

    <p>
      These Math methods are mathematical functions that compute new values from
      their arguments. You may be able to guess what <c>abs</c>, <c>pow</c>, and
      <c>sqrt</c> do, from their abbreviations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <c>Math.abs</c> takes a single argument, either a <c>double</c> or an
      <c>int</c> and returns a value of the same type which is the absolute
      value of the argument. The absolute value is the positive value of the
      number without its sign or its distance from 0. So:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
Math.abs(45);    // returns 45
Math.abs(-45);   // returns 45
Math.abs(33.3);  // returns 33.3
Math.abs(-33.3); // returns 33.3
      </code>
    </program>

    <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/pow.png" width="14%" alt="Pow!" />
    <p>
      <c>Math.pow</c> takes two argument, both <c>double</c>s and returns a
      <c>double</c> which is the first argument raised to the power of the
      second argument.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
Math.pow(2 , 3); // returns 8.0
Math.pow(10, 6); // returns 1000000.0
Math.pow(2, -3); // returns 0.125
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      <c>Math.sqrt</c> takes an <c>double</c> argument and returns a positive
      <c>double</c> value which is the square root of the argument. For example,
      the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 squared is 9.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
Math.sqrt(9); // returns 3.0
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Since these methods calculate and return a value, you need to use that
      value, for example in an assignment statement or in a print statement to
      see the result. For example:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
System.out.println("The square root of 9 is " + Math.sqrt(9));
      </code>
    </program>

    <activity label="trymath">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Try the Math methods below. Change the code so that it computes the
          absolute value of -4, the square root of 9, and 3 raised to the power

    <p>
      The <c>Math.random()</c> method returns a double number greater than or
      equal to 0.0, and less than 1.0. When we talk about ranges of numbers
      sometimes we need to be precise about whether the ends of the range are
      part of the range. For example, <c>Math.random</c> returns a number
      between 0 and 1, but does that mean it can return exactly 0? Or exactly 1?
      As it turns out it can return 0 but never returns 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we need to be precise about this we’d say that it returns a number
      between 0, <em>inclusive</em>, and 1, <em>exclusive</em>, meaning
      <em>include</em> 0 but <em>exclude</em> 1. Lots of ranges in Java are
      expressed this way, as you’ll see later on with an inclusive bottom and
      exclusive top.

    <p>
      Getting a number between 0, inclusive, and 1, exclusive, may not seem all
      that useful. But we can expand the range easily enough. To see how,
      imagine you had less than a dollar to your name and you wanted to be
      richer—you’d want to find a way to <term>multiply</term> your money. If
      you could invest every penny you had in something that would multiply your
      money by 1,000 then instead of having somewhere between $0 and $1, then
      you’d have somewhere between $0 (inclusive—if you started with $0) and
      $1,000 (exclusive, since if you had even a fraction of a penny less than
      $1 multiplying by 1,000 would still leave you just a bit shy of $1,000.)
      If the investment multiplied your original money by a million, you’d have
      between $0 and $1,000,000! (But never <em>quite</em> $1,000,000.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Same trick applies to random numbers. The value <c>Math.random</c> returns
      is like the initial amount of money in your pocket, always a bit less than
      $1. If you multiply that value by any amount, it will stretch it into the
      range you want:

      You may have noticed that while the numbers generated were always in the
      range 0 to 10, all the numbers probably had a lot a digits after the
      decimal point. Often we want a random integer, with nothing after the
      decimal point. Easy enough—casting a <c>double</c> to an <c>int</c> will
      throw away any values after the decimal point. For example,

    <p>
      Finally, what if we want a number in a range that doesn’t start with 0,
      say a number from 1 to 10 (including 10) instead of from 0 to 9 (including
      9)? Since the size of the two ranges is the same, with ten numbers in
      each, all we need to do is shift from the range we’ve generated into the
      range we want. In other words, add the difference between the two ranges,
      1 in this case.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// rnd is an integer in the range 1-10 (including 10).
int rnd = (int)(Math.random()*10) + 1;

          Run the code below several times to see how the value changes each
          time. How could you change the code to return a random integer from 1
          to 10? Modify the code and see if your answer is correct. Try removing
          the parentheses from around (Math.random() * 10) and run the code
          several times. What happens? The parentheses are necessary because
          (int) will cast the closest expression, and (int)Math.random() will
          always be 0 since anything after the decimal point is dropped.

    <program language="java">
      <code>
// Math.random() returns a random number between 0.0-0.99.
double rnd = Math.random();

// rnd1 is an integer in the range 0-9 (including 9).
int rnd1 = (int)(Math.random()*10);

// rnd2 is in the range 1-10 (including 10). The parentheses are necessary!
int rnd2 = (int)(Math.random()*10) + 1;

// rnd3 is in the range 5-10 (including 10). The range is 10-5+1 = 6.
int rnd3 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 5;

// rnd4 is in the range -10 up to 9 (including 9). The range is doubled (9 - -10 + 1 = 20) and the minimum is -10.
int rnd4 = (int)(Math.random()*20) - 10;

    <p>
      So the general recipe for generating a random is to first stretch the
      value from <c>Math.random()</c> until it’s in the right size range by
      multiplying by the size of the range. Then if you want an integer value,
      cast to <c>int</c> to discard the part after the decimal point. Then shift
      the value up by adding the minimum value. The table below shows some
      applications of that general recipe.

    <p>
      You may have a combination lock on your locker at school where you have to
      spin the dial to 3 separate numbers from 0 up to 40. What if you forgot
      your combination? Would you be able to guess it?
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol marker="1">
        <li>
          <p>
            Write code that will generate 3 random integers from 0 up to 40 (but
            not including 40) using <term>Math.random()</term> in the Active
            Code window below. Run it a couple times to see it generate
            different numbers.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            How many times would you need to run it to guess your combination
            correctly? Let’s have the code compute the number of permutations
            possible in your combination lock using
            <term>Math.pow(number,exponent)</term>. For example, if you had to
            spin the dial twice on your combination lock where each spin can
            choose a digit from 0-9 (10 digits), there are <m>10^{2}</m>
            possible permutations. In Java, this would be written as
            <term>Math.pow(10,2)</term> which means 10 to the power of 2. If you
            start listing all the permutations possible, you can tell that there
            are <m>10^{2}</m> or 100 possible permutations for a 2 spins on a
            dial lock from 0-9.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre>
00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
...
90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now what about the combination lock for this challenge? You will need to
      spin the dial 3 times: once to the right, once to the left, and once to
      the right to 3 different numbers from 0 up to 40 (not including 40). In
      general, the formula to use is <m>NumbersPerDial^{numberOfSpins}</m>.
      Write this using the <term>Math.pow()</term> method in your code and save
      it into a variable and print out.

      Here’s another challenge that is a lot of fun! Can you use random numbers
      to make dancing turtles? This idea was suggested by CSA teacher Zac
      Martin.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Complete the random numbers using Math.random() in the correct ranges
          to choose x, y coordinates and random color in the range of 0-255 for
          the turtle. Put on some music and watch your turtle dance!
