    <title>Comments</title>
    <p>
      Adding comments to your code helps to make it more readable and
      maintainable. In the commercial world, software development is usually a
      team effort where many programmers will use your code and maintain it for
      years. Commenting is essential in this kind of environment and a good
      habit to develop. Comments will also help you to remember what you were
      doing when you look back to your code a month or a year from now. Comments
      are written for both the original programmer and other programmers to
      understand the code and its functionality, but are ignored by the compiler
      and are not executed when the program is run.
    </p>

    <p>There are 3 types of comments in Java:</p>
    <p>
      <ol marker="1">
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>//</c> Single line comment
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>/*</c> Multiline block of comments <c>*/</c>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>/**</c> Java documentation comments <c>*/</c>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      The special characters <c>//</c> are used to mark the rest of the line as
      a comment in many programming languages. If the comment is going to be
      multiple lines, we use <c>/*</c> to start the comment and <c>*/</c> to end
      the comment.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also a special version of the multi-line comment, <c>/**</c> ...
      <c>*/</c>, called the documentation comment. Java has a cool tool called
      <url href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm"
      visual="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm">javadoc</url>
      that comes with the <url
      href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"
      visual="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java
      JDK</url> that will pull out all of these comments to make documentation
      of a class as a web page. This tool generates the official Java
      documentation too, for example for the <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">String
      class</url>. Although you do not have to use this in the AP exam, it’s a
      good idea to use the documentation comment in front of classes, methods,
      and instance variables in case you want to use this tool later on to save
      your code as a library.

    <p>
      The compiler will skip over comments, and they don’t affect how your
      program runs. They are for you, your teacher, and other programmers
      working with you. Here are some examples of good commenting:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
/**
* MyClass.java
* @author My Name
* @since Date
* This class keeps track of the max score.
*/
public class MyClass()
{
   private int max = 10; // this keeps track of the max score
   /* The print() method prints out the max */
   public print()
   {
      System.out.println(max);
   }
}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Note that most IDEs will tend to show comments formatted in italics – to
      make them easier to spot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that there are some special tags that you can use in Java
      documentation. These are not required but many programmers use them. Here
      are some common tags:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>@author Author of the program</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>@since Date released</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>@version Version of program</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>@param Parameter of a method</p>
        </li>

        <li>

    <title>Preconditions and Postconditions</title>
    <p>
      Many methods in API libraries have <term>preconditions</term> and the
      <term>postconditions</term> described in their comments. A
      <term>precondition</term> is a condition that must be true for your method
      code to work, for example the assumption that the parameters, the data
      that you give the method to do its job, have values within limits and are
      not null. The methods could check for these preconditions, but they do not
      have to. The precondition is what the method expects in order to do its
      job properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>postcondition</term> is a condition that is true after running the
      method. It is what the method promises to do. Postconditions describe the
      outcome of running the method, for example what is being returned from the
      method or the changes to the state. These assumptions are very useful to
      other programmers who want to use that method and get the correct results.
    </p>

    <p>
      One precondition that we talked about is that divisors cannot be zero in
      expressions because that will cause the code to have a runtime error or
      exception. Many math functions have preconditions about their operands
      because not every mathematical operation is defined for every value. For
      example, computing the square root of a negative number is undefined, so
      the <c>Math.sqrt(num)</c> Java method, which we will learn later, will
      return a special value <c>NaN</c> which stands for “not a number” if num
      is negative. But since you can’t really do anything useful with <c>NaN</c>
      it’s better to think of <c>sqrt</c> as having a precondition that says it
      only works properly if given a positive argument. These are described as
      special cases in the API documentation, for example in <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F8%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt-double"
      visual="https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F8%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt-double">https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F8%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt-double</url>. Try this out below.

        <p>
          The following code uses the square root method in Java which has a
          precondition that the number that you give it is not negative. When
          you click on run, the compiler will not catch the error, but it will
          return the error value <c>NaN</c>. Can you fix the value of num so
          that it does not return <c>NaN</c>? What is the precondition for the
          Math.sqrt method?

      Here is an example of preconditions, postconditions, and @param in the
      Turtle code that we use for animating turtle drawings. The Turtle
      <c>forward</c> method’s precondition is that the amount of <c>pixels</c>
      forward should be between 0 and the width and height of the world. If it
      receives value out of this range, it sets <c>pixels</c> to the closest
      legal values that it can so that the turtle appears just at the edge of
      the world.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
/**
  * Method to move the turtle forward the given number of pixels
  * @param pixels the number of pixels to walk forward in the heading direction
  * Preconditions: parameters pixel is between 0 and
  *    the width and height of the world.
  * Postconditions: the turtle is moved forward by pixels amount
  *   but stays within the width and height of the world.

  <subsection xml:id="software-validity-and-use-case-diagrams">
    <title>Software Validity and Use-Case Diagrams</title>
    <p>
      Preconditions and postconditions are covered on the AP CSA exam. Software
      validity, testing, and use-case diagrams which are discussed in this
      subsection are not covered on the AP CSA exam, but they are described here
      because they use preconditions and postconditions and are used by
      professional programmers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Determining the preconditions and postconditions help us to test our code
      and determine the <term>validity</term> of our software. Software validity
      tests whether the software does what it is supposed to do before it is
      released. This is sometimes very important. For example, if the code is
      part of a satellite going to outerspace or is going to be used in an
      emergency condition, we want to test it thoroughly and make sure it works
      and is valid before it is put into use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Good software testers actually try to break the code! They try all kinds
      of input to see what the software will do because you never know what
      users will try or what conditions there will be. So, always think what the
      preconditions of your code are and see what happens when you break them,
      and then see if you can protect or warn against that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preconditions and postconditions can also help us to design better
      software systems. Software designers often first draw a high-level
      <term>Use-Case Diagram</term> of a system that shows the different ways
      that a user might interact with a system before they build it. Here is a
      simple Use-Case Diagram of a restaurant system. It shows 2 actors in the
      system: the customer and the staff at the restaurant, and 3 use-cases in
      circles. A <term>Use-case</term> is a particular user interaction or
      situation in the system or software, and they often become methods in the
      program.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Use-Case Diagram of a Restaurant System</caption>
      <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/use-case-restaurant.png" width="89%" alt="Use Case Diagram" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      After drawing a Use-Case Diagram, designers write down the preconditions
      and the postconditions for each Use-Case. Often the successful post-
      condition for one use-case becomes the preconditions for the next use-
      case. For example, for the “Order Food” and “Eat Food” Use Cases:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Preconditions for “Order Food”: Customer enters restaurant. Staff is
            ready to take the order.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Postconditions for “Order Food”: Customer orders the food. Staff
            takes the order.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Preconditions for “Eat Food”: Customer has already ordered food.
            Staff has delivered food.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Postcondition for “Eat Food”: Customer eats the food.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>

    <title>Agile Software Development</title>
    <p>
      There are many different models for software development. The
      <term>waterfall model</term>, developed in the 1970s, is a step by step
      model where each phase is finished before the next phase begins. This
      model has recently been criticized because it is not very adaptable. The
      more recent <term>Agile</term> development model involves iterative,
      incremental development where teams works in short 2-3 week
      <term>sprints</term> to completely develop, test, and release a component
      of the project to the customer for feedback. It is very adaptable as
      project requirements change because of early testing, immediate customer
      feedback and collaboration.

              No, score should not be negative. Preconditions do not usually
              enforce negative values.

              Correct. It is reasonable that the score should be a positive

              computeScore is a method, not a variable. Preconditions are
              usually for variables.
