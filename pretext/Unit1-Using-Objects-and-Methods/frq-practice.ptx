  <title>Unit 1 Free Response Question (FRQ) Practice</title>
  <introduction>
    <idx>free response questions</idx>
    <idx>FRQ</idx>
    <p>
      The AP CSA exam has 4 free response questions (FRQs) where you have to
      write Java code in 1.5 hours. The first FRQ is about Methods and Control
      Structures worth 7 points using expressions, methods, loops, and <c>if</c>
      statements in two parts (A and B). Students will write two methods or one
      constructor and one method of a given class based on provided
      specifications and examples. In Part A (4 points), the method or
      constructor will require students to write iterative or conditional
      statements, or both, as well as statements that call methods in the
      specified class. In Part B (3 points), the method or constructor will
      require calling String methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although we have not yet covered enough to complete an FRQ, the following
      is an adaptation of the 2022 FRQ #1 part a about the points earned in a
      video game with 3 levels using the class <c>Level</c>. You will try the
      simplified version of the FRQ in this lesson using just expressions and
      method calls, and then you will do the complete FRQ part a in the next
      unit after you learn about <c>if</c> statements.

    <title>FRQ Description of Level Class</title>
    <p>
      This question involves simulation of a single-player video game. In the
      game, a player attempts to complete three levels. A level in the game is
      represented by the <c>Level</c> class which keeps track of their points in
      a level and whether they have reached the end or goal of that level.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
public class Level
{
    /* The number of points the user has in this level */
    private int points;
    /* Whether the goal of the level has been reached */
    private boolean goal;

    /** Constructor for the Level class */
    public Level(int p, boolean g)
    {
        points = p;
        goal = g;
    }

    /** Returns the number of points (a positive integer) recorded for this level */
    public int getPoints()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** Returns true if the player reached the goal on this level and returns false otherwise */
    public boolean goalReached()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.

    <p>
      In this simplified version of this FRQ, you will declare 3 <c>Level</c>
      objects for the 3 levels of the game and then call their
      <c>getPoints()</c> methods to calculate the score for the game. The score
      is calculated by adding the points from each level, but in this version,
      level 2 points are doubled and level 3 points are tripled.
    </p>

    <activity label="frq-simple-game-score">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the main method, declare 3 objects of the <c>Level</c> class called
          <c>level1</c>, <c>level2</c>, and <c>level3</c> with the following
          points and goals: 100 points and true, 100 points and true, and 200
          points and true. Then, calculate the score for the game by adding the
          points from each level using their <c>getPoints()</c> method, but
          double the level 2 points and triple the level 3 points.

        // and 200 points and true

        // 2. Calculate the score for the game by adding the points
        // from each level using their getPoints() method
