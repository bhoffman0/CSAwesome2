  <title>Mixed Up Code Practice 1.1-1.6</title>
  <p>Try to solve each of the following mixed-up code problems or try the experimental switch between mixed up or write code versions of these problems on the next page instead.</p>
  <p>For these mixed up code problems, drag the blocks into the correct order. Click the <em>Check Me</em> button to check each solution.  You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block.  Some of the problems may have an extra block that isn’t needed in the correct solution. After 3 tries, you can ask for help and some of the blocks will be combined. You can solve these on your phone or other mobile device!</p>
