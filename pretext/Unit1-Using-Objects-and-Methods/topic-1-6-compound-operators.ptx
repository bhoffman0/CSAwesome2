  <title>Compound Assignment Operators</title>

  <introduction>
    <idx>compound operators</idx>
    <p>
      Compound assignment operators <c>+=</c>, <c>-=</c>, <c>*=</c>, <c>/=</c>,
      and <c>%=</c> are shortcuts that do a math operation and assignment in one
      step. For example, <c>x += 1</c> adds 1 to the current value of <c>x</c>
      and assigns the result back to <c>x</c>. It is the same as <c>x = x +
      1</c>. This pattern is possible with any operator put in front of the
      <c>=</c> sign, as seen below.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a way to remember the order of the two characters in the
      compound operators, think about the order things happen: first we use the
      math operator, such as <c>+</c>, to get the new value and then the value
      is assigned back to the variable with <c>=</c>. So it’s operator then
      equals sign: <c>+=</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since changing the value of a variable by one is especially common, there
      are two extra concise operators <c>++</c> and <c>--</c>, also called the
      plus-plus or <term>increment</term> operator and minus-minus or
      <term>decrement</term> operator that set a variable to one greater or less
      than its current value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus <c>x++</c> is even more concise way to write <c>x = x + 1</c> than
      the compound operator <c>x += 1</c>. You’ll see this shortcut used a lot
      in loops when we get to them. Similarly, <c>y--</c> is a more concise way
      to write <c>y = y - 1</c>. These shortcuts only exist for <c>+</c> and
      <c>-</c> as they don’t really make sense for other operators.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        If you’ve heard of the programming language C++, the name is an inside
        joke that C, an earlier language which C++ is based on, had been
        incremented or improved to create C++.
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      Here’s a table of all the compound arithmetic operators and the extra
      concise increment and decrement operators and how they relate to fully
      written out assignment expressions. You can run the code below the table
      to see these shortcut operators in action!

    <note>
      <p>
        If you look at real-world Java code, you may occassionally see the
        <c>++</c> and <c>--</c> operators used before the name of the variable,
        like <c>++x</c> rather than <c>x++</c>. That is legal but not something
        that you will see on the AP exam.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the operator is after the variable name (called the
        <term>postfix</term> operator), the value of the variable is changed
        <em>after</em> evaluating the variable to get its value. And if the
        operator is before the variable (the <term>prefix</term> operator), the
        value of the variable in incremented <em>before</em> the variable is
        evaluated to get the value of the expression. For example, if <c>x</c>
        is 10 and we write, <c>System.out.println(x++)</c> it will print 10 but
        aftewards <c>x</c> will be 11. On the other hand if we write,
        <c>System.out.println(++x)</c>, it will print 11 and afterwards the
        value will be 11.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AP exam will never use the prefix form of these operators nor will
        it use the postfix operators in a context where the value of the
        expression matters.

    <p>
      <term>Code Tracing</term> is a technique used to simulate a dry run
      through the code or pseudocode line by line by hand as if you are the
      computer executing the code. Tracing can be used for debugging or proving
      that your program runs correctly or for figuring out what the code
      actually does.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trace tables can be used to track the values of variables as they change
      throughout a program. To trace through code, write down a variable in each
      column or row in a table and keep track of its value throughout the
      program. Some trace tables also keep track of the output and the line
      number you are currently tracing.

            (AP 1.6.A.1) Compound assignment operators (<c>+=</c>, <c>-=</c>,
            <c>*=</c>, <c>/=</c>, <c>%=</c>) can be used in place of the
            assignment operator in numeric expressions. A compound assignment
            operator performs the indicated arithmetic operation between the
            current value of the variable on the left and the value on the right
            and then assigns the resulting value to the variable on the left.
