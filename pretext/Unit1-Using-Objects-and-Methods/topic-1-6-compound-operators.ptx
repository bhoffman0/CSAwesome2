    <title>Compound Assignment Operators</title>
    <p>Compound assignment operators are shortcuts that do a math operation and
            assignment in one step. For example, <c>x += 1</c> adds 1 to the current value of
            <c>x</c> and assigns the result back to <c>x</c>. It is the same as <c>x = x + 1</c>.
            This pattern is possible with any operator put in front of the <c>=</c> sign, as
            seen below. If you need a mnemonic to remember whether the compound operators
            are written like <c>+=</c> or <c>=+</c>, just remember that the operation (<c>+</c>) is
            done first to produce the new value which is then assigned (<c>=</c>) back to the
            variable. So it’s operator then equal sign: <c>+=</c>.</p>
    <p>Since changing the value of a variable by one is especially common, there are
            two extra concise operators <c>++</c> and <c>--</c>, also called the plus-plus or
            <term>increment</term> operator and minus-minus or <term>decrement</term> operator that set a
            variable to one greater or less than its current value.</p>
    <p>Thus <c>x++</c> is even more concise way to write <c>x = x + 1</c> than the compound
            operator <c>x += 1</c>. You’ll see this shortcut used a lot in loops when we get to
            them in Unit 4. Similarly, <c>y--</c> is a more concise way to write <c>y = y - 1</c>.
            These shortcuts only exist for <c>+</c> and <c>-</c> as they don’t really make sense
            for other operators.</p>
    <note>
            <p>If you’ve heard of the programming language C++, the name is an inside joke
                that C, an earlier language which C++ is based on, had been incremented or
                improved to create C++.</p>
        </note>
    <p>Here’s a table of all the compound arithmetic operators and the extra concise
            incremend and decrement operators and how they relate to fully written out
            assignment expressions. You can run the code below the table to see these
            shortcut operators in action!</p>

    <note>
            <p>If you look at real-world Java code, you may occassionally see the <c>++</c> and
                <c>--</c> operators used before the name of the variable, like <c>++x</c> rather
                than <c>x++</c>. That is legal but not something that you will see on the AP
                exam.</p>
            <p>Putting the operator before or after the variable only changes the value of
                the expression itself. If <c>x</c> is 10 and we write,
                <c>System.out.println(x++)</c> it will print 10 but aftewards <c>x</c> will be 11.
                On the other hand if we write, <c>System.out.println(++x)</c>, it will print 11
                and afterwards the value will be 11.</p>
            <p>In other words, with the operator after the variable name, (called the
                <term>postfix</term> operator) the value of the variable is changed <em>after</em> evaluating
                the variable to get its value. And with the operator before the variable (the
                <term>prefix</term> operator) the value of the variable in incremented <em>before</em> the
                variable is evaluated to get the value of the expression.</p>
            <p>But the value of <c>x</c> after the expression is evaluated is the same in
                either case: one greater than what it was before. The <c>--</c> operator works
                similarly.</p>
            <p>The AP exam will never use the prefix form of these operators nor will it use
                the postfix operators in a context where the value of the expression matters.</p>

            <p>Use paper and pencil or the question response area below to trace through the following program to determine the values of the variables at the end.</p>
            <p><term>Code Tracing</term> is a technique used to simulate a dry run through the code or pseudocode line by line by hand as if you are the computer executing the code. Tracing can be used for debugging or proving that your program runs correctly or for figuring out what the code actually does.</p>
            <p>Trace tables can be used to track the values of variables as they change throughout a program. To trace through code, write down a variable in each column or row in a table and keep track of its value throughout the program. Some trace tables also keep track of the output and the line number you are currently tracing.</p>
