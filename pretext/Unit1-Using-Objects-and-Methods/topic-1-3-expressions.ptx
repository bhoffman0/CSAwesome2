            <title>Output</title>
            
            
            <p>Java has two different methods to print output to the screen:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p><term>System.out.println(value)</term> : prints the value followed by a new line (ln)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><term>System.out.print(value)</term> : prints the value without advancing to the next line</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p><c>System.out.println("Hi there!");</c> prints out the characters between the first <c>"</c> and the second <c>"</c> followed by a new line.  The <c>"Hi there!"</c> is called a <term>string literal</term> which is zero to many characters enclosed in starting and ending double quotes. A <term>literal</term> is the code representation of a fixed value, which can be a string or a numerical value.</p>

<exercise label="printCommands">
    <statement>
            <p>Run this code to see the output below it. How would you change it to print the ! on the same line as Hi there keeping all 3 print statements?</p>

            <p>What if you wanted to print out a double quote ” character? Since the double quote ” is a special character with meaning in Java, we put in a backslash in front of the quote to signal that we want just the character. This is called a <term>backslash escape sequence</term>. And if you wanted to print out a backslash, you would have to backslash it too in order to escape its special meaning. Another useful backslashed character is backslash \n which will put in a newline.</p>

            <title>Expressions and Operators</title>
            <p><term>Arithmetic Expressions</term> consist of numeric values, variables, and arithmetic operators that evaluate to a single numerical value.  For example, the expression <c>2 + 3</c> evaluates to 5.</p>
            
            
            <p>Java uses the standard mathematical operators for addition (<c>+</c>), subtraction
                (<c>-</c>), and division (<c>/</c>). The multiplication operator is written as <c>*</c>, as
                it is in most programming languages, since the character sets used until
                relatively recently didn’t have a character for a real multiplication sign,
                <c>×</c>, and keyboards still don’t have a key for it or for <c>÷</c>. (You may have noticed that <c>+</c> was also used to combine
                <c>String</c> and other values into new <c>String</c>s. More on this later.)</p>
            <p>Arithmetic expressions can be of type <c>int</c> or <c>double</c>. An arithmetic
                expression consisting only of <c>int</c> values will evaluate to an <c>int</c> value.
                An arithmetic expression that uses at least one <c>double</c> value will evaluate
                to a <c>double</c> value. This means that when you are doing division with two integers, you will get an integer result and the decimal part of the result will be thrown away. This is called <term>truncating division</term>. If you want a double result, you should make at least one of the values in the expression a double like 2.0.</p>
            <p><problematic refid="id2">|CodingEx|</problematic> <term>Coding Exercise:</term></p>

<exercise label="lcop1">
    <statement>
            <p>Run the code below to see all the operators in action. Do all of those operators do what you expected? What about 2 / 3? Isn’t it surprising that it prints 0?  See the note above about truncating division with integers. Change the code to make it print the decimal part of the division too. You can do this by making at least one of the numbers a double like 2.0.</p>

            <p>Math errors sometimes lead to runtime errors in code. For example, when the Hubble Space Telescope was launched to space in 1990, a math coding error in a formula caused it to point in the wrong direction! It missed its target stars by about half a degree which is about the width of the moon seen from Earth (<url href="https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1990/rt9005/900510/05100615.htm" visual="https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1990/rt9005/900510/05100615.htm">https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1990/rt9005/900510/05100615.htm</url>). Thorough testing is the only way to make sure there are no logic errors that will cause runtime errors in your code. Try the following example that tries to convert centimeters to inches. Can you fix the runtime error?</p>

            <p>Another runtime error that is possible in math expressions is dividing by zero which is undefined in mathematics. An attempt to divide an integer by the integer 0 will result in an <term>ArithmeticException</term> in Java, as we saw in the first lesson. Try it in one of the active codes to see what happens.</p>

            <title>Compound Expressions</title>
            <p>Expressions can be combined into <term>compound expressions</term> with multiple operators.  When compound expressions are evaluated, <term>operator precedence</term> rules are used, just like when we do math (remember PEMDAS?), so that multiplication <c>*</c>, division <c>/</c>, and remainder <c>%</c> are done before addition <c>+</c> and subtraction <c>-</c>. However, anything in parentheses is done first. It doesn’t hurt to put in extra parentheses if you are unsure as to what will be done first or just to make it more clear.</p>

            <title>The Remainder Operator</title>
            <p>The operator <c>%</c> in Java is the <term>remainder</term> operator. Like the other
                arithmetic operators is takes two operands. Mathematically it returns the
                remainder after dividing the first number by the second, using truncating integer division.
                For instance, <c>5 % 2</c> evaluates to 1 since 2 goes into 5 two times
                with a remainder of 1.</p>
            <p>While you may not have heard of remainder as an operator, think back to
                elementary school math. Remember when you first learned long division, before
                they taught you about decimals, how when you did a long division that didn’t
                divide evenly, you gave the answer as the number of even divisions and the
                remainder. That remainder is what is returned by this operator. In the figures
                below, the remainders are the same values that would be returned by <c>2 % 3</c>
                and <c>5 % 2</c>.</p>
            <figure align="center"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Figure 1: Long division showing the integer result and the remainder</caption><image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/mod-py.png" width="27%%"/></figure>
            <p>Sometimes people—including Professor Lewis in the next video—will call <c>%</c>
                the <term>modulo</term>, or <term>mod</term>, operator. That is not actually correct though the
                difference between remainder and modulo, which uses Euclidean division instead
                of truncating integer division, only matters when negative operands are involved
                and the signs of the operands differ. With positive operands, remainder and mod give the same results.
                Java does have a method <c>Math.floorMod</c> in the <c>Math</c> class if you need to use modulo instead of remainder, but <c>%</c> is all you need in the AP exam.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.A.1) <title_reference>System.out.print</title_reference> and <title_reference>System.out.println</title_reference> are Java output statements that display information on the computer screen. <title_reference>System.out.println</title_reference> moves the cursor to a new line after the information has been displayed, while <title_reference>System.out.print</title_reference> does not.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.B.1) A <term>literal</term> is the code representation of a fixed value, which can be a string or a numerical value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.B.2) A <term>string literal</term> is a sequence of zero to many characters enclosed in starting and ending double quotes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.B.3) <term>Escape sequences</term> are special sequences of characters that can be included in a string. They start with a <title_reference>` and have a special meaning in Java. Escape sequences used in this course include double quote `”</title_reference>, backslash <title_reference>`, and newline `n</title_reference>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.1) <term>Arithmetic expressions</term>, which consist of numeric values, variables, and operators, include expressions of type  <c>int</c> and <c>double</c>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.2) The arithmetic <term>operators</term> consist of <c>+</c>, <c>-</c>, <c>*</c> , <c>/</c>, and <c>%</c>
                        also known as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.2) An arithmetic operation that uses two <c>int</c> values will evaluate to an <c>int</c> value. With integer division, any decimal part in the result will be thrown away.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.2) An arithmetic operation that uses at least one <c>double</c> value will evaluate to a <c>double</c> value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.3) When dividing numeric values that are both int values, the result is only the integer portion of the quotient. Anything after the decimal point is thrown away. When dividing numeric values that use at least one double value, the result is the double quotient as expected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.4) The <term>remainder (modulo) operator %</term> is used to compute the remainder when one number is divided by another number.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.5) Multiple operators can be used to combine expressions into <term>compound expressions</term>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.5) During evaluation, numeric values are associated with operators according to <term>operator precedence</term> to determine how they are grouped. <c>*</c>, <c>/</c>, <c>%</c> have precedence over <c>+</c> and <c>-</c>, unless parentheses are used to group those to be evaluated first. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>(AP 1.3.C.6) An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an <c>ArithmeticException</c>.</p>
