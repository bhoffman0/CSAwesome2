  <introduction>
    <p>
      A lot of what happens when a computer program runs is invisible, happening
      only within the computer’s memory. But ultimately we need some way to
      convey information to humans outside the computer. If running the program
      has no effect on the world outside the computer, what was the point of
      running it? These days computers can communicate with the outside world in
      all sorts of ways: sound, graphics, animated videos, even physical robots
      moving around the world. But one of the simplest ways for a program to
      communicate with us is to emit textual output to the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section we will learn how to print values to the screen and then
      how to use <term>operators</term> to create <term>expressions</term> that
      compute new values from other values allowing us to write programs that
      actually do something.
    </p>

    <title>Output</title>

    <idx>String</idx>
    <idx>String literal</idx>
    <p>Java has two different methods to print output to the screen:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>System.out.println(value)</c> prints the the textual
            representation of value followed by a new line (<c>println</c> is an
            abbreviation for “print line”.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>System.out.print(value)</c> prints the textual representation of
            value without advancing to the next line
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>value</em> between the parentheses can be any Java
      <term>expression</term> which just means some bit of code that produces a
      value. One simple kind of expression is a <term>literal value</term> which
      is a way of representing a value directly—or literally—in our code. For
      instance <c>42</c> is a literal expression representing the <c>int</c>
      value 42. When we print a value with <c>print</c> or <c>println</c>, Java
      converts the value to its textual representation and then emits that to
      the screen. So we could write <c>System.out.print(42)</c> to print the
      text <c>42</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another useful kind of literal value for generating output is a
      <term>string literal</term>. A string, in programming, is a sequence of
      textual characters like letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces, etc. If we
      wanted to store any text, from a person’s name to the contents of a novel,
      in a program, we would represent it as a string. Java provides a
      <c>String</c> data type that we’ll learn more about in <xref
      ref="topic-1-15-strings"/> but for now we just need to know we can write
      string literals by enclosing the text we want in quotation marks:
      <c>""</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance <c>"Hi there!"</c> is a string literal whose value is the
      text: <c>Hi there!</c>. The quotation marks are not part of the value;
      they are the syntax for writing the string literal. Thus the code
      <c>System.out.println("Hi there!");</c> prints the text <c>Hi there!</c>
      on the screen, without the quotation marks, and then advances to the next
      line.
    </p>

    <title>String escapes</title>

    <p>
      What if you wanted to print out a double quote <c>"</c> character? Since
      <c>"</c> has a special meaning within Java’s string literals, it might
      seem there’d be no way to include it within a string. However, Java
      provides a way to write string literals that contain double quotes using a
      mechanism called <term>escaping</term>. To “escape” the normal syntax of a
      string literal, where a quotation mark would indicate the end of the
      string, we put a backslash (<c>\</c>) in front of the quotation mark which
      tells Java to include the following quotation mark in the string value
      rather than treating it as the end of the literal. This is called a
      <term>backslash escape sequence</term>. Since backslash is used this way,
      that also makes <em>it</em> a special character, so if we want to include
      a backslash in a string literal, we need to escape it with another
      backslash! There are a handful of other backslash escape sequences. The
      only other one the College Board wants you to know about is <c>\n</c>
      which will be translated to a newline character, which will break the text
      across lines.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, different operating systems use different characters to
        represent the end of a line. <c>println</c> actually uses whatever is
        appropriate on the computer the program is running on. On MacOS and
        Linux that will be the same character as we can write in a string
        literal with <c>\n</c>. On Windows, however, it will be the two
        character sequence that would be written <c>\r\n</c>. To make our code
        run the same everywhere, we’d have to use only <c>println</c> when we
        want a new line. The College Board does want you to know about the
        <c>\n</c> escape sequence, however.

    <title>Arithmetic Expressions</title>
    <p>
      In the last section we saw how variables, such as <c>score</c>, can be
      used to name a place we store a value. And in this section we’ve seen how
      we can write literal values like <c>42</c> in our programs. Both variables
      and literal values are simple kinds of <term>expressions</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also learned in <xref ref="topic-1-2-variables" /> how data types are
      defined by both by set of values they can represent and the set of
      operators that can operate on those values. Now we are going to see how we
      can use operators to create more complex expressions that compute new
      values from other expressions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To take a simple example, <c>2 + 3</c> is an expression consisting of the
      two literal values <c>2</c> and <c>3</c> and the operator <c>+</c>. The
      values are sometimes called the <term>operands</term> of the expression.
      The <c>+</c> operator works in Java about how you expect, adding together
      its two operands and producing a new value, in this case <c>5</c>. The
      expression <c>2 + 3</c> is an example of an <term>arithmetic
      expression</term>, an expressions consisting of numeric values being
      operated on by one of Java’s arithmetic operators.

    <p>
      Java uses the standard mathematical operators for addition (<c>+</c>),
      subtraction (<c>-</c>), and division (<c>/</c>). The multiplication
      operator is written as <c>*</c>, as it is in most programming languages,
      since the character sets used until relatively recently didn’t have a
      character for a real multiplication sign, <c>×</c>, and keyboards still
      don’t have a key for it. For similar reasons the <c>÷</c> symbol is not
      used in Java.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like variables have a type that was determined when we declared it,
      expressions have a type that is determined by the kind of value they
      produce. Arithmetic expressions can be of type <c>int</c> or <c>double</c>
      depending on the types of the values in the expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      An arithmetic expression consisting only of <c>int</c> values will always
      evaluate to an <c>int</c> value, even if the true mathematical result is
      not an integer. But an arithmetic expression that contains at least one
      <c>double</c> value will always evaluate to a <c>double</c> value.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that when if we divide two <c>int</c>s, we will get an
      <c>int</c> result and the decimal part of the result will be thrown away.
      So, for instance, <c>5 / 2</c> would give us <c>2</c>, not <c>2.5</c>.
      This is called <term>truncating division</term>. If we want to preserve
      the part after the decimal point we need a <c>double</c> result, so we
      should make at least one of the values in the expression a double like
      2.0. The expression <c>5 / 2.0</c> will give us <c>2.5</c>.

  <subsection xml:id="the-remainder-operator">
    <title>The Remainder Operator</title>
    <p>
      Java also supports a fifth arithmetic operator, <c>%</c>, called the
      <term>remainder</term> operator. Like the other four basic arithmetic
      operators it takes two operands. Mathematically it returns the remainder
      after dividing the first number by the second, using truncating division.
      For instance, <c>5 % 2</c> evaluates to 1 since 2 goes into 5 two times
      with a remainder of 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      While you may not have heard of remainder as an operator, think back to
      elementary school math when you first learned long division, before you
      learned about decimals. You probably learned how to give the answer to a
      long division that didn’t divide evenly in terms of the number of even
      divisions and the remainder. The remainder is what is returned by the
      <c>%</c> operator. In the figures below, the remainders are the same
      values that would be returned by <c>2 % 3</c> and <c>5 % 2</c>.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>Long division showing the integer result and the remainder</caption>
      <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/mod-py.png" width="27%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Sometimes people—including Professor Lewis in the next video—will call
      <c>%</c> the <term>modulo</term>, or <term>mod</term>, operator. That is
      not actually correct though the difference between remainder and modulo,
      which uses <url
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division">Euclidean
      division</url> instead of truncating integer division, only matters when
      the signs of the operands differ. With operands of the same sign,
      remainder and modulo give the same results. Java does have a method
      <c>Math.floorMod</c> in the <c>Math</c> class if you need to use modulo
      instead of remainder, but <c>%</c> is all you need in the AP exam and it
      will only be used with positive operands.

      While computers are pretty good at math they will only do what we tell
      them. And sometimes what we tell them isn’t exactly what we wanted. For
      instance, we can get bit by an unexpected truncating division if we divide
      two <c>int</c>s when we really wanted a <c>double</c> result.
    </p>

    <p>
      And sometimes it’s something as silly as using the wrong operator. For
      example, when the Hubble Space Telescope was launched to space in 1990, a

      Another kind of math bug is when we ask Java to do something
      mathematically impossible. The main one we need to know about is what
      happens when we divide by zero, something that is not defined in math. In
      an <c>int</c> expression, dividing by 0 will result in an
      <term>ArithmeticException</term> , as we saw in the <xref
      ref="topic-1-1-intro-algorithms"/>. Try it in one of the active codes to
      see what happens.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        In <c>double</c> expressions, dividing by zero is not an error. Instead
        we get a special <c>double</c> value <c>Infinity</c> which might makes
        sense to you if you’ve learned about limits in math class. But if not,
        don’t worry about it; it’s not part of the AP exam.

    <title>Compound Expressions</title>
    <p>
      Each arithmetic operator operates on just two operands. So what does an
      expression like <c>2 * 3 + 4</c> mean? If we remember our PEMDAS, we know
      in regular math that this expression should evaluate to <c>10</c> since we
      first multiply <c>2</c> times <c>3</c>, getting <c>6</c>, and then add
      <c>4</c> to that, getting <c>10</c>. It works the same in Java. Java
      evaluates the <c>*</c> operator with the two operands are <c>2</c> and
      <c>3</c>, and then the <c>+</c> operator with the value of the
      subexpression <c>2 * 3</c> and <c>4</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This kind of expression, where one or both of the operands are also
      arithmetic expressions, not just variables or a literal values, is called
      a <term>compound expression</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When compound expressions are evaluated, Java uses <term>operator
      precedence</term> rules, just like we do in regular math. So the
      expression <c>2 + 5 * 3</c> is <c>17</c>, not <c>21</c> because the
      expression <c>5 * 3</c> is evaluated first and then becomes one of the
      operands to the <c>+</c> operator.
    </p>


    <p>
      In Java, multiplication <c>*</c>, division <c>/</c>, and remainder
      <c>%</c> are done before addition <c>+</c> and subtraction <c>-</c>.
      However, as under PEMDAS rules, anything in parentheses is done first. It
      doesn’t hurt to put in extra parentheses if you are unsure as to what will
      be done first or just to make it more clear.

          In the example below, try to guess what it will print out and then run
