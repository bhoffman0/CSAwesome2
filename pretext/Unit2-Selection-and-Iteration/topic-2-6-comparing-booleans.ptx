      What if you heard a rumor about a senior at your high school? And then you
      heard that the rumor wasn’t true - it wasn’t a senior at your high school.
      Which part of “a senior at your high school” wasn’t true? Maybe they
      weren’t a senior? Or maybe they didn’t go to your high school? You could
      write this as a logic statement like below using negation (<c>!</c>) and
      the <term>and</term> (<c>&amp;&amp;</c>) operator since both parts have to
      be true for the whole statement to be true. (Thank you to Kevin Saxton
      from Kent School, CT for this example.)
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
!(a &amp;&amp; b)

a = "senior"
b = "at our high school"

// This means it is not true that (a) it is a senior
// and (b) someone at our high school.
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      In this lesson, you will learn about De Morgan’s Laws which simplify
      statements like this. We know that !(a senior at our high school) could
      mean !(a senior) or !(at our high school). Let’s learn more about De
      Morgan’s Laws.

    <title>De Morgan’s Laws</title>
    <p>
      De Morgan’s Laws were developed by Augustus De Morgan in the 1800s. They
      show how to simplify the negation of a complex boolean expression, which
      is when there are multiple expressions joined by an <term>and</term>
      (<c>&amp;&amp;</c>) or <term>or</term> (<c>||</c>), such as <c>(x &lt; 3)
      &amp;&amp; (y &gt; 2)</c>. When you negate one of these complex
      expressions, you can simplify it by flipping the operators and end up with
      an equivalent expression. De Morgan’s Laws state the following
      equivalencies. Here’s an easy way to remember De Morgan’s Laws: <term>move
      the NOT inside, AND becomes OR</term> and <term>move the NOT inside, OR
      becomes AND</term>.
    </p>

      <caption>De Morgan’s Laws to simplify complex expressions</caption>

    </figure>

    <p>
      In Java, De Morgan’s Laws are written with the following operators:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <c>!(a &amp;&amp; b)</c> is equivalent to <c>!a || !b</c>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <c>!(a || b)</c> is equivalent to <c>!a &amp;&amp; !b</c>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Going back to our example above, !(a senior &amp;&amp; at our high school)
      is equivalent to !(a senior) or !(at our high school) using De Morgan’s
      Laws:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
!(a &amp;&amp; b) is equivalent to !a || !b

a = "senior"
b = "at our high school"
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      You can also simplify negated boolean expressions that have relational
      operators like <c>&lt;</c>, <c>&gt;</c>, <c>==</c>. You can move the
      negation inside the parentheses by flipping the relational operator to its
      opposite sign. For example, not (c equals d) is the same as saying c does
      not equal d. An easy way to remember this is <term>To move the NOT, flip
      the sign</term>. Notice that <c>==</c> becomes <c>!=</c>, but <c>&lt;</c>
      becomes <c>&gt;=</c>, <c>&gt;</c> becomes <c>&lt;=</c>, <c>&lt;=</c>
      becomes <c>&gt;</c>, and <c>&gt;=</c> becomes <c>&lt;</c> where the sign
      is flipped and an equal sign may also be added or removed.
    </p>

          <li>

    <title>Truth Tables</title>
    <p>
      Although you do not have to memorize De Morgan’s Laws for the CSA Exam,
      you should be able to show that two boolean expressions are equivalent.
      One way to do this is by using truth tables. For example, we can show that
      <c>!(a &amp;&amp; b)</c> is equivalent to <c>!a || !b</c> by constructing
      the truth table below and seeing that they give identical results for the
      2 expressions (the last 2 columns in the table below are identical!).

    <title>Simplifying Boolean Expressions</title>
    <p>
      Often, you can simplify boolean expressions to create equivalent
      expressions. For example, applying De Morgan’s Laws to <c>!(x &lt; 3
      &amp;&amp; y &gt; 2)</c> yields <c>!(x &lt; 3) || !(y &gt; 2)</c> as seen
      in the figure below. This can then be simplified further by flipping the
      relational operators to remove the not. So, <c>!(x &lt; 3) || !(y &gt;
      2)</c> is simplified to <c>(x &gt;= 3 || y &lt;= 2)</c> where the
      relational operators are flipped and the negation is removed. These two
      simplification steps are seen below.

  <subsection xml:id="comparing-objects">
    <title>Comparing Objects</title>
    <p>
      Comparing objects is a little different than comparing primitive typed
      values like numbers. Objects can be very complex and have many attribute
      values or instance variables inside them. For example, the <c>Turtle</c>
      objects have many instance variables like <c>name</c>, <c>width</c>,
      <c>height</c>, <c>xPos</c>, <c>yPos</c>, etc. When comparing two
      <c>Turtle</c> objects, we need a specially written <term>equals</term>
      method to compare all of these values. In the next sections, we will take
      a look at <c>String</c> objects and the difference between comparing them
      with <c>==</c> vs. the <c>equals</c> method.
    </p>
  </subsection>

    <title>String Equality</title>
    <idx>
      <h>String</h><h>equality</h>
    </idx>

    <idx>
      <h>String</h><h>equals</h>
    </idx>

    <p>
      The <term>equals</term> method for Strings compares two strings letter by
      letter. <c>s1.equals(s2)</c> is true if <c>s1</c> and <c>s2</c> have all
      the same characters in the same order. With <c>Strings</c> and other
      objects, you almost always use <c>equals</c> instead of <c>==</c> to check
      their equality.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the operator <c>==</c> or <c>!=</c> is used to compare object
      variables, it returns true when the two variables <em>refer to the same
      object</em>. These variables are called <term>object references</term> and
      <term>aliases</term> for the same object. With strings this happens when
      one string variable is set to another.

    <p>
      Note that you can also create <c>Strings</c> using string literals instead
      of new, like <c>String s = "Hello"</c>. <c>String</c> literals behave a
      little differently because they are re-used if they already exist instead
      of creating a new object. But you should not see questions with string
      literals and <c>==</c> on the AP exam.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        Only use <c>==</c> and <c>!=</c> with primitive types like <c>int</c> or
        to test if two strings (or objects) refer to the same object. Use
        <c>equals</c>, not <c>==</c> or <c>!=</c>, with strings to test if they
        are equal letter by letter, and with other objects to see if all of
        their relevant attributes are equal.

              s1.equals(s3) would be true since they have the same characters in

    <title>Comparing with null</title>
    <p>
      One common place to use <c>==</c> or <c>!=</c> with objects is to compare
      them to <term>null</term> to see if they really exist. Sometimes
      short-circuit evaluation is used to avoid an error if the object doesn’t
      exist. Remember that <term>short-circuit evaluation</term> is used with
      <c>&amp;&amp;</c> in Java meaning that if the first part of the if
      condition is false, it doesn’t even have to check the second condition and
      it knows the whole <c>&amp;&amp;</c> test is false.
    </p>

    <activity label="nullTest">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Try the following code to see a <c>NullPointerException</c> (if you
          don’t see the exception because of the autograding, you can copy it
          into the pencil icon scratch area to run it without the grader). Since
          <c>s</c> is <c>null</c>, trying to access <c>indexOf</c> on <c>s</c>
          throws an <c>NullPointerException</c>. Comment out the first <c>if</c>
          statement and run the program again. The second <c>if</c> statement
          avoids the error with shortcircuit evaluation. Because <c>s !=
          null</c> is <c>false</c>, the rest of the Boolean expression is not
          evaluated. Now, change <c>s</c> to set it to <c>"apple"</c> instead of
          <c>null</c> in the first line and run the code again to see that the
          <c>if</c> statements can print out that “apple contains an a”.

      <term>String Equality</term>: What will the following code print out?
      Trace through the code by drawing diagrams of what is going on in memory
      like the figures above, and then show the values of s1, s2, s3, s4 and the
      output after each line of code. Remember that you can use trace tables to
      track the values of variables as they change throughout a program. To
      trace through code, write down a variable in each column in a table and
      keep track of its value throughout the program as you go through it line
      by line.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
String s1 = null;
String s2 = new String("hi");
String s3 = new String("hi");
String s4 = new String("bye");
if (s1 == null)
{
    s1 = s2;
}
if (s1 == s2)
{
    System.out.println("s1 and s2 refer to the same object");

            (AP 2.6.A.1) Two Boolean expressions are equivalent if they evaluate

            (AP 2.6.B.1) Two different variables can hold references to the same
            object. Object references can be compared using <c>==</c> and

            references an object.

            using attributes from the two objects.
