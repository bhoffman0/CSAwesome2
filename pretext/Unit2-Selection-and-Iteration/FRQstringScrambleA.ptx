      The following is part a of a free response question from 2014. It was
      question 1 on the exam. You can see all the free response questions from
      past exams at <url
     href="https://www.savemyexams.com/ap/computer-science/college-board/a/past-papers/">Past AP CSA Exams</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Question 1.</term> This question involves reasoning about strings
      made up of uppercase letters. You will implement two related methods that
      appear in the same class (not shown). The first method takes a single
      string parameter and returns a scrambled version of that string. The
      second method takes a list of strings and modifies the list by scrambling
      each entry in the list. Any entry that cannot be scrambled is removed from
      the list.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Part a.</term> Write the method <em>scrambleWord</em>, which takes a
      given word and returns a string that contains a scrambled version of the
      word according to the following rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The scrambling process begins at the first letter of the word and
            continues from left to right.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If two consecutive letters consist of an “A” followed by a letter
            that is not an “A”, then the two letters are swapped in the
            resulting string.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Once the letters in two adjacent positions have been swapped,
            neither of those two positions can be involved in a future swap.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example we are looping through the characters from left to right
      one at a time and comparing the two adjacent characters. If the first is
      an “A” and the second is not we will swap the characters and then need to
      increment the index to not check the ones we swapped again. So we start
      checking the characters at index 0 and 1 and then swap them, but then move
      to comparing 2 and 3 rather than 1 and 2 which means we increment the
      current index by 2. If we don’t swap the characters we only increment the
      index by 1.

    <p>
      In this case since we didn’t swap any characters we only increment the
      index by 1 each time through the loop.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code will need to loop through the characters in the string and
      compare two adjacent characters. There are two ways to compare two
      adjacent characters without going beyond the bounds of the loop. One way
      is to start the index at 0 and loop while the index is less than one less
      than the length of the string and then get the characters at the index and
      at the index plus one. Another way is to start the index at 1 and loop
      while the index is less than the length of the string and then get the
      characters at one less than the index and at the index. If the first
      character is an “A” and the second is not an “A” then swap them and
      increment the index to make sure that you don’t check characters that have
      already been swapped. Each time through the loop also increment the index.
