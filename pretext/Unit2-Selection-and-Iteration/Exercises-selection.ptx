                    <p>Choice II won't work since if you had a score of 94 it would first assign the grade to an "A" but then it would execute the next if and change the grade to a "B" and so on until the grade was set to a "C". This could have been fixed by using else if instead of just if.</p>

        <statement>

            <p> Assuming that x and y have been declared as valid integer values, which of the following is equivalent to this statement?</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
(x &gt; 15 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 18) || (x &gt; 10 || y &lt; 20)

                <feedback>
                    <p>This can't be right as it's only checking the x variable, however the original statement can solely depend on the y variable in some cases.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>There's a third condition on x that can affect the output of the statement which is not considered in this solution.</p>

            <choice correct="yes">

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>The commutative property allows the terms to be switched around, while maintaining the value. In this case, the || symbol is used with the commutative property and the statement included the &amp;&amp; must stay together to follow the laws of logic.</p>
