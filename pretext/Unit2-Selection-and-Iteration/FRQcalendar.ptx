 <idx>FRQ</idx>

    <p>The AP exam’s first free response question (FRQ) is on Methods and Control Structures as of 2019. This question 1 uses expressions, loops, and if statements. The AP exam provides the method header with some parameter variables and other methods that you will need to call in the solution. This question does not involve more complex topics such as arrays.</p>
    <p>FRQ Question 1 on Control Structures will probably involve:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a <term>for-loop</term> that probably uses the method’s parameter variables,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an <term>if statement</term>, probably inside the loop,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>calls to other class <term>methods given to you</term>,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a numerical or string value that is calculated by the loop and <term>returned</term> at the end of the method.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>if the question has 2 parts, 1 part will probably require a loop and the other just an expression.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>On question 1, you will get points for:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                <p>constructing the loop correctly,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>calling the correct methods,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>calculating the correct value,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>and returning the value.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Try to have some code for each of these steps. Do not use arrays or other more complex code. You may need to use Math or string methods.</p>

            <p>The 2019 FRQ 1 is a good example of what to expect.

            <title>Part A: numberOfLeapYear()</title>
            <p>Write the static method numberOfLeapYears, which returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. In order to calculate this value, a helper method is provided for you.</p>

            <subsection>
                <p>It is usually easiest to use a <term>for loop</term> if you know how many times the loop should execute using the given information. Figure out what the initial and ending values of the loop variable should be. Some of the method parameters will usually be used for these. In this case, we need to loop from year1 to year2.  The preconditions stated for the method tells us that we don’t have to worry about year1 and year2 being out of order or below 0. So don’t waste time on error-checking these values. Here’s a possible loop:</p>
                <program language="java"><code>
for(int i = year1 ; i &lt;= year2 ; i++)
{

}
</code></program>
                <p>Note that you are given a method to use called isLeapYear(). The method header for it says that it returns a boolean. Any method that starts with the word “is” usually returns a boolean. If it returns a boolean, that is a signal to you that you should use it in an if statement. The method will usually take an argument. If it is used inside the loop, this could be the loop variable. For example,</p>
                <program language="java"><code>
if (isLeapYear(i))
    ...
</code></program>
                <p>Put all of the code together to solve this problem.</p>

            <title>Part B: dayOfWeek()</title>
            <p>In part B of the AP Calendar FRQ, you need to write the code inside a static method <term>dayOfWeek</term>, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, …, and 6 denotes Saturday.  This seems difficult at first, but helper methods are given to you to do most of the work. You just need to put them together to calculate the value. The helper methods given to you are:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p><term>firstDayOfYear(year)</term> returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, …, and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, firstDayOfYear(2019) returns 2.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><term>dayOfYear(month, day, year)</term> returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example, dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year, while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>If you know that 1/1/2019 was a Tuesday (2) using the firstDayYear method, and you know that today is the nth day of the year using the dayOfYear method, you can figure out what day of the week today is by adding those together. Try some examples by revealing the problems below.</p>

                <p>If we used the formula in the exercise above for the date 1/8/2019, we would get 9:</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>firstDayOfYear(2019) + dayOfYear(1,8,2019) - 1 = 2 + 8 - 1 = 9</p>
                    </li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>But there is no 9th day of week. There are only 7 days of the week. So when we reach a Sunday, we must start back at 0. This is a place where the remainder operator % is useful. Note that 9 % 7 = 2 which means that 1/8/2019 is the 2nd day of the week starting at 0.</p>
            
            <p>The FRQ that involves writing an expression will probably use the <term>remainder operator</term> (<c>%</c>). Remember these tips about when to use the <c>%</c> operator:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Use remainder whenever you need to wrap around to the front if the value goes over the limit (<c>num % limit</c>). For example here for weekdays or for hours and minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use remainder to check for odd or even numbers (<c>num % 2 != 0</c>) is odd and (<c>num % 2 == 0</c>) is even. Actually, you can use it to check if any number is evenly divisible by another (<c>num1 % num2 == 0</c>).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use <c>%</c> to get the last digit from an integer number (<c>num % 10</c> gives the last digit on right).</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>Try the <c>%</c> operator below.</p>
