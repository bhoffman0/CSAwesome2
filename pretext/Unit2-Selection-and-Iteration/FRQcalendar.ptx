    <idx>FRQ</idx>
    <p>
      The AP exam’s first free response question (FRQ) is on Methods and Control
      Structures using expressions, loops, and if statements. Students will
      write two methods or one constructor and one method of a given class based
      on provided specifications and examples. In Part A (4 points),the method
      or constructor will require students to write iterative or conditional
      statements, or both, as well as statements that call methods in the
      specified class. In Part B (3 points), the method or constructor will
      require calling String methods. The AP exam provides the method header
      with some parameter variables and other methods that you will need to call
      in the solution. This question does not involve more complex topics such
      as arrays.
    </p>

    <p>FRQ Question 1 on Control Structures will probably involve:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            a <term>for-loop</term> that probably uses the method’s parameter
            variables,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            an <term>if statement</term>, probably inside the loop,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            calls to other class <term>methods given to you</term>,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            a numerical or string value that is calculated by the loop and
            <term>returned</term> at the end of the method.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            if the question has 2 parts, 1 part will probably require a loop and
            the other just an expression.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>On question 1, you will get points for:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>constructing the loop correctly,</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>calling the correct methods,</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>calculating the correct value,</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>and returning the value.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Try to have some code for each of these steps. Do not use arrays or other
      more complex code. You may need to use Math or string methods.

    <p>Question 1.</p>
    <p>
      The APCalendar class contains methods used to calculate information about

  <subsection xml:id="part-a-numberofleapyear">
    <title>Part A: numberOfLeapYear()</title>
    <p>
      Write the static method numberOfLeapYears, which returns the number of
      leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. In order to calculate this
      value, a helper method is provided for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>isLeapYear(year)</term> returns true if year is a leap year
            and false otherwise.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Complete method numberOfLeapYears below. You must use isLeapYear
      appropriately to receive full credit.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
/** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive.

    <title>How to solve numberOfLeapYears()</title>
    <p>First, circle the information given that you will need to use:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>the parameters year1 and year2</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>the isLeapYear(year) method</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, circle what the return type of what you need to return. In this
      case, the return type of numberOfLeapYears is int and you need to
      calculate the number of leap years between year1 and year2 and return it.
      Declare a variable for this return value and return it at the end of the
      method to get 1 point.
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
/** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive.
 * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2

 {
    int numLeapYears = 0;
    // Your loop will go in here

    return numLeapYears;
 }

    <p>
      It is usually easiest to use a <term>for loop</term> if you know how many
      times the loop should execute using the given information. Figure out what
      the initial and ending values of the loop variable should be. Some of the
      method parameters will usually be used for these. In this case, we need to
      loop from year1 to year2. The preconditions stated for the method tells us
      that we don’t have to worry about year1 and year2 being out of order or
      below 0. So don’t waste time on error-checking these values. Here’s a
      possible loop:
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
for(int i = year1 ; i &lt;= year2 ; i++)
{

}
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      Note that you are given a method to use called isLeapYear(). The method
      header for it says that it returns a boolean. Any method that starts with
      the word “is” usually returns a boolean. If it returns a boolean, that is
      a signal to you that you should use it in an if statement. The method will
      usually take an argument. If it is used inside the loop, this could be the
      loop variable. For example,
    </p>

    <program language="java">
      <code>
if (isLeapYear(i))
    ...
      </code>
    </program>

  <subsection xml:id="part-b-dayofweek">
    <title>Part B: dayOfWeek()</title>
    <p>
      In part B of the AP Calendar FRQ, you need to write the code inside a
      static method <term>dayOfWeek</term>, which returns the integer value
      representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year),
      where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, …, and 6 denotes Saturday. This
      seems difficult at first, but helper methods are given to you to do most
      of the work. You just need to put them together to calculate the value.
      The helper methods given to you are:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>firstDayOfYear(year)</term> returns the integer value
            representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where 0
            denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, …, and 6 denotes Saturday. For
            example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, firstDayOfYear(2019) returns
            2.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>dayOfYear(month, day, year)</term> returns n, where month,
            day, and year specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of
            the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned.
            This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example,
            dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year,
            while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you know that 1/1/2019 was a Tuesday (2) using the firstDayYear method,
      and you know that today is the nth day of the year using the dayOfYear
      method, you can figure out what day of the week today is by adding those
      together. Try some examples below.

      If we used the formula in the exercise above for the date 1/8/2019, we
      would get 9:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>firstDayOfYear(2019) + dayOfYear(1,8,2019) - 1 = 2 + 8 - 1 = 9</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      But there is no 9th day of week. There are only 7 days of the week. So
      when we reach a Sunday, we must start back at 0. This is a place where the
      remainder operator % is useful. Note that 9 % 7 = 2 which means that
      1/8/2019 is the 2nd day of the week starting at 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      The FRQ that involves writing an expression will probably use the
      <term>remainder operator</term> (<c>%</c>). Remember these tips about when
      to use the <c>%</c> operator:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use remainder whenever you need to wrap around to the front if the
            value goes over the limit (<c>num % limit</c>). For example here for
            weekdays or for hours and minutes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use remainder to check for odd or even numbers (<c>num % 2 != 0</c>)
            is odd and (<c>num % 2 == 0</c>) is even. Actually, you can use it
            to check if any number is evenly divisible by another (<c>num1 %
            num2 == 0</c>).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use <c>%</c> to get the last digit from an integer number (<c>num %
            10</c> gives the last digit on right).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Try the <c>%</c> operator below.
