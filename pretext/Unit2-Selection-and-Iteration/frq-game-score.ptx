  <title>Unit 3 Free Response Question (FRQ) Game Practice</title><introduction>
    
    <p>The AP CSA exam has 4 free response questions (FRQs) where you have to write Java code in 1.5 hours. The first FRQ is about Methods and Control Structures using expressions, methods, loops, and if statements. In the last unit, we tried a simplified FRQ 1 part a about the points earned in a video game with 3 levels using the class <c>Level</c>. You will now try the complete 2022 FRQ 1 part a from <url href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-frq-computer-science-a.pdf" visual="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-frq-computer-science-a.pdf">https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-frq-computer-science-a.pdf</url>.</p>

            <title>FRQ 1 Part A Description (2022)</title>
            <p>This question involves simulation of the play and scoring of a single-player video game. In the game, a player attempts to complete three levels. A level in the game is represented by the <c>Level</c> class.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
public class Level
{
    /** Returns true if the player reached the goal on this level and returns false otherwise */
    public boolean goalReached()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** Returns the number of points (a positive integer) recorded for this level */
    public int getPoints()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
</input></program>
            <p>Play of the game is represented by the <c>Game</c> class. You will write a method of the Game class.</p>
            <program language="java"><input>
public class Game
{
    private Level levelOne;
    private Level levelTwo;
    private Level levelThree;

    /** Postcondition: All instance variables have been initialized. */
    public Game()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** Returns true if this game is a bonus game and returns false otherwise */
    public boolean isBonus()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** Simulates the play of this Game (consisting of three levels) and updates all relevant
    * game data
    */
    public void play()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** Returns the score earned in the most recently played game, as described in part (a) */
    public int getScore()
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    /** Simulates the play of num games and returns the highest score earned, as
    * described in part (b)
    * Precondition: num &gt; 0
    */
    public int playManyTimes(int num)
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
</input></program>
            <p>In part a, you will write the <c>getScore</c> method, which returns the score for the most recently played game. Each game consists of three levels. The score for the game is computed using the following helper methods.</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The <c>isBonus</c> method of the Game class returns true if this is a bonus game and returns false otherwise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The <c>goalReached</c> method of the Level class returns true if the goal has been reached on a particular level and returns false otherwise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The <c>getPoints</c> method of the Level class returns the number of points recorded on a particular level. Whether or not recorded points are earned (included in the game score) depends on the rules of the game, which follow.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>The <c>score</c> for the game is computed according to the following rules.</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Level one points are earned only if the level one goal is reached.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Level two points are earned only if both the level one and level two goals are reached.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Level three points are earned only if the goals of all three levels are reached.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The score for the game is the sum of the points earned for levels one, two, and three.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the game is a bonus game, the score for the game is tripled.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>

            <title>Warm up Exercises</title>
            <p>FRQs often have a lot of dense text. It is a good idea to highlight important keywords and the methods and variables that you will need.</p>
            <p><ol marker="1">

                <li>

            <p>Letâ€™s write the code for the <c>getScore()</c> method. The method should use the <c>goalReached()</c> and <c>getPoints()</c> methods of the <c>Level</c> class to calculate the score for the game. It will need to check if the goal is reached for each level using the <c>levelOne</c>, <c>levelTwo</c>, and <c>levelThree</c> objects and add the points for each level to the score.  If the game is a bonus game, which can be checked with the <c>isBonus()</c> method (no object needed since it is in the same class), the score will be tripled. At the end of the method, a <c>return</c> statement will return the score to the main method to be printed out.</p>
