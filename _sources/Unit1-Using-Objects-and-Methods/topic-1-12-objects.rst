Objects - Instances of Classes
===============================

Java is an **object-oriented programming** language. That means that one of the
primary ways of designing and organizing a Java program is in terms of **objects**. Objects combine data and the code that operates on that data into
a single unit. To create objects, we first define a **class** which provides
a blueprint for creating the objects. In Java, all programs are built out of classes. This is why, every Java program starts with ``public class``. In this unit, you will learn the vocabulary of object-oriented programming and to create and use objects of a class written for you. In later units, you will learn to write your own classes.  

What are Classes and Objects?
------------------------------

You can think of a class as something like a blueprint of a house that is used to construct houses (objects), or like a cookie cutter that is used to create the cookies (objects). The cookie cutter (class) can
be used to create as many cookies (objects) as you want. The cookies (objects) are all the same shape and size, but they can have different colors and decorations.

    Figure 1: Using a blueprint (class) to construct houses (objects) or a cookie cutter (class) to make cookies (objects) 

You can also think of a class as defining a new data type. In this lesson, we will use the class ``Turtle`` to make animated turtle objects. Just like you use ``int`` to
declare variables that hold numbers, you can use ``Turtle`` to declare many variables, animated turtle objects, who are **instances** of the ``Turtle`` class.

Attributes and Behaviors
--------------------------

A class defines the **attributes** (data) and **behaviors** (methods) that all objects of that class will have. The objects are the specific **instances** of the class that have their own values for the attributes.  **Attributes** are the data or properties that an object knows about itself, for example, a turtle object's color and size. **Behaviors** are the things that an object can do. For example, a turtle object can go forward, turn left, or turn right. The attributes and behaviors of a class are defined in the class, but each object has its own values for the attributes.

This |video3| shows another class called ``Belt`` and how it has 3 instance variables to define its attributes. Every belt object can have different values stored in the instance variables.

The following picture has lots of cats (objects of the type cat). They are all
different, but they share the same attributes and behaviors that make up a cat.
They are all **instances** of cat with different values for their attributes.
Name some of the attributes and behaviors of the cats below. For example, the
color (*attribute*) of the first cat is black (*attribute value*) and it is
playing (*behavior*).

.. shortanswer:: cats

    Discuss with your class: What are some attributes of cats? What are some
    behaviors of cats? (Note that attributes are often nouns or adjectives
    describing features of cats, and behaviors are often verbs).

The following picture of a turtle shows some of the Turtle **attributes** like name, width, height, color in the body of the turtle and its **methods** like forward(), backward(), written around the turtle.

Turtle Class
-----------------------------

The Turtle class (that we've written for you and hidden on this page) is a blueprint for turtle objects. It defines attributes for graphical turtles like their color and position and methods to make the turtles move. Try the Java program below that creates a Turtle object called yertle using the Turtle class.

The **dot operator** (.) is used to run an object's method. You can think of the (.) as asking the object to do something (execute one of its methods).  For example, ``yertle.forward()`` asks the turtle ``yertle`` to go ``forward``. It doesn't tell ``yertle`` how much to go forward, so it goes forward 100 pixels by default. The parentheses ``()`` after a method name are there in case you need to give the method **arguments** (some data) to do its job, for example to go forward 50 pixels instead of 100 in ``yertle.forward(50);`` Try changing the code above to go forward 50 pixels instead and then run it again.

            int count = countOccurences(code, expect);

            boolean passed = getResults("2 time(s)", "" + count + " time(s)", "yertle.forward() twice");

            assertTrue(passed);
        }
    }

A variable like ``yertle`` of a **reference** type like ``Turtle`` holds an object reference, which can be thought of as the memory address of that object. Variables that are of a primitive types like ``int`` hold just a single number value. But objects are complex and contain a collection of values called **attributes**, for example the color and the size of the turtle.

Creating Turtle Objects
------------------------

When you write a class like the ``Turtle`` class, you can create many objects of that class type. In the code below,
two turtle objects are created: ``yertle`` and ``myrtle``.  You can name your turtle and add in a line like the following in the main method to make it move:

.. code-block:: java

    // To create or declare a new object, write:
    // ClassName variableName = new ClassName(arguments);
    Turtle yourTurtleName = new Turtle(habitat);
    yourTurtlename.forward();

Class Hierarchy and Inheritance
--------------------------------

.. index::
    single: inheritance
    single: superclass
    single: subclass
    single: Object

Another important concept in object-oriented programming is **inheritance**. Although the AP CSA exam no longer covers inheritance, you should know what it means. **Inheritance** is a way to create a new class that is based on an existing class. The new class, called a **subclass**, inherits the attributes and behaviors of the existing class, called a **superclass**.  In Java, all classes are subclasses of a superclass called **Object**. 

For example, you could have a superclass called ``Pet`` with attributes like ``name`` and ``age`` and behaviors like ``eat`` and ``sleep``. You could then have subclasses like ``Dog`` and ``Cat`` and ``Turtle`` that inherit the attributes and behaviors of the ``Pet`` class. Each subclass could add attributes and behaviors specific to that type of pet. For example, a ``Dog`` subclass could have an attribute called ``breed`` and a behavior called ``bark``.

Turtle Methods
----------------

Let's practice more with the ``Turtle`` class and its methods.
Here is a class diagram that shows some of the attributes and methods in the class ``Turtle``.

    Figure 5: Turtle Class Diagram

The Turtle world does not use the Cartesian coordinate system with (0,0) in the middle the screen. Instead, (0,0) is at the top left corner of the screen and x increases to the right and y increases towards the bottom of the screen. Most computer graphics systems use this coordinate system which is a carry over from before computers could display graphics and had to approximate the graphics with text print outs.

|Groupwork| Programming Challenge : Draw Letters
-------------------------------------------------

Working in pairs, use the area below to have your turtle draw simple block-style letters for your first or last name initials using just straight lines (no curves or diagonals). 

It may help to act out the code pretending you are the turtle. Remember that which way you turn depends on which direction you are facing, and the turtle begins facing north (towards the top of the page).

Here are some simple turtle methods that you can use:

- ``forward()``
- ``turnLeft()``
- ``turnRight()``
- ``backward()``
- ``penUp()``
- ``penDown()``

You may notice that it is challenging to have your turtle draw with these simple methods. In the next lessons, we will use more complex ``Turtle`` methods where you can indicate how many steps to take or what angle to turn that will make drawing a lot easier!

Summary
-------------------

- A **class** defines a new data type (a classification). It is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the *attributes* and *behaviors* of the objects of that class.

- An **object** is a specific **instance** of a class with defined attributes. Objects are declared as variables of a class type.

- A variable of a reference type holds an object reference, which can be thought of as the memory address of that object.

- An **attribute** or **instance variable** is data the object knows about itself. For example a turtle object knows the direction it is facing or its color.

- A **behavior** or **method** is something that an object can do.  For example a turtle object can go forward 100 pixels.

- A **class hierarchy** can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a single class called a **superclass**. Classes that **extend** a superclass, called **subclasses**, can draw upon the existing attributes and behaviors of the superclass without replacing these in the code. This creates an **inheritance** relationship from the subclasses to the superclass. Designing and implementing inheritance relationships are outside the scope of the AP Computer Science A course and exam.

- All classes in Java are subclasses of the **Object** class.

.. mchoice:: AP-attributes
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: An attribute of the name object is String.
   :answer_b: An attribute of the pet object is name.
   :answer_c: An instance of the pet class is Dog.
   :answer_d: An attribute of the Dog instance is pet.
   :answer_e: An instance of the Dog object is pet.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: name is an attribute of the pet object or Dog class.
   :feedback_b: name is an attribute of the pet object or Dog class.
   :feedback_c: An instance of the Dog class is pet.
   :feedback_d: An attribute of the Dog class is name.
   :feedback_e: An instance of the Dog class is pet.

   A student has created a ``Dog`` class. The class contains variables to represent the following.
    - A String variable called ``breed`` to represent the breed of the dog
    - An int variable called ``age`` to represent the age of the dog
    - A String variable called ``name`` to represent the name of the dog

    The object ``pet`` is declared as type Dog.
    Which of the following descriptions is accurate?


.. mchoice:: AP-objects
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: boolean is an attribute of the myParty object.
   :answer_b: myParty is an attribute of the Party class.
   :answer_c: myParty is an instance of the Party class.
   :answer_d: myParty is an attribute of the Party instance.
   :answer_e: numOfPeople is an instance of the Party object.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: boolean is the type of an attribute, but not an attribute.
   :feedback_b: myParty is an instance of the Party class.
   :feedback_c: myParty is an object that is an instance of the Party class.
   :feedback_d: An attribute of the Party class is numOfPeople.
   :feedback_e: An attribute of the Party class is numOfPeople.

    A student has created a ``Party`` class. The class contains variables to represent the following.
    - An int variable called ``numOfPeople`` to represent the number of people at the party.
    - A boolean variable called ``discoLightsOn`` to represent whether the disco ball is on.
    - A boolean variable called ``partyStarted`` to represent whether the party has started.

    The object ``myParty`` is declared as type Party. Which of the following descriptions is accurate?
