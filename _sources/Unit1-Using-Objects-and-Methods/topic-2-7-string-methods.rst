String Methods
=================

.. index::
    pair: String; length
    pair: String; substring
    pair: String; indexOf
    pair: String; compareTo
    pair: String; equals
    pair: String; methods

A string holds characters in a sequence.  Each character is at a position or **index** which starts with 0 as shown below.  An **index** is a number associated with a position in a string.  The length of a string is the number of characters in it including any spaces or special characters.  The string below has a length of 14.

    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 1: A string with the position (index) shown above each character

.. note::

   The first character in a string is at index 0 and the last characters is at **length** -1.

For the AP CSA exam, you only need to know how to use the following String methods.  All of the String method descriptions are included in the |AP CSA Reference Sheet| that you get during the exam so you don't have to memorize these.


    -  **int length()** method returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters like punctuation.

    -  **String substring(int from, int to)** method returns a new string with the characters in the current string starting with the character at the ``from`` index and ending at the character *before* the ``to`` index (if the ``to`` index is specified, and if not specified it will contain the rest of the string).

    -  **int indexOf(String str)** method searches for the string ``str`` in the current string and returns the index of the beginning of ``str`` in the current string or -1 if it isn't found.

    -  **int compareTo(String other)** returns a negative value if the current string is less than the ``other`` string alphabetically, 0 if they have the same characters in the same order, and a positive value if the current string is greater than the ``other`` string alphabetically.

    -  **boolean equals(String other)** returns true when the characters in the current string are the same as the ones in the ``other`` string.  This method is inherited from the Object class, but is **overridden** which means that the String class has its own version of that method.


String Methods: length, substring, indexOf
------------------------------------------

Run the code below to see the output from the String methods ``length``, ``substring``, and ``indexOf``. The length method returns the number of characters in the string, not the last index which is length -1. The ``str.substring(from,to)`` method returns the substring from the ``from`` index up to (but not including) the ``to`` index. The method ``str.indexOf(substring)`` searches for the substring in str and returns the index of where it finds substring in str or -1 if it is not there.

CompareTo and Equals
-----------------------

We can compare primitive types like int and double using operators like ``==`` and ``<`` or ``>``, which you will learn about in the next unit. However, with reference types like String, you must use the methods ``equals`` and ``compareTo``, not ``==`` or ``<`` or ``>``.

The method ``compareTo`` compares two strings character by character. If they are equal, it returns 0. If the first string is alphabetically ordered before the second string (which is the argument of ``compareTo``), it returns a negative number. And if the first string is alphabetically ordered after the second string, it returns a positive number. (The actual number that it returns does not matter, but it is the distance in the first letter that is different, e.g. A is 7 letters away from H.)

.. figure:: Figures/compareTo.png
    :width: 350px
    :align: center
    :alt: compareTo
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 2: compareTo returns a negative or positive value or 0 based on alphabetical order

The ``equals`` method compares the two strings character by character and returns ``true`` or ``false``. Both ``compareTo`` and ``equals`` are case-sensitive. There are case-insensitive versions of these methods, ``compareToIgnoreCase`` and ``equalsIgnoreCase``, which are not on the AP exam.

Run the example below to see the output from ``compareTo`` and ``equals``. Since ``"Hello!"`` would be alphabetically ordered after ``"And"``, ``compareTo`` returns a positive number. Since ``"Hello!"`` would be alphabetically ordered before ``"Zoo"``, ``compareTo`` returns a negative number.  Notice that ``equals`` is case-sensitive.

.. |String class| raw:: html

   <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank">String class</a>

There are lots of other methods in the String class.  You can look through the Java documentation for the |String class| online.   You don't have to know all of these for the exam, but you can use them if you want to on the exam.

An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a library of prewritten classes that simplify complex programming tasks for us. These classes are grouped together in a **package** like java.lang and we can import these packages (or individual classes) into our programs to make use of them. For instance, we have just discussed the String library built into the default java.lang package - it takes care of the detailed work of manipulating strings for us.  There are many other useful library packages as well, both in the java.lang package and in other packages. Documentation for APIs and libraries are essential to understanding how to use these classes.

.. note::

   Strings are **immutable** which means that they can't change. Anything that you do to modify a string (like creating a substring or appending strings) returns a new string.

   :answer_a: hi th
   :answer_b: hi the
   :answer_c: hi ther
   :answer_d: hi there
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The substring method returns the string starting at the first index and not including the last index.  The method indexOf returns the index of the first place the string occurs.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if substring returned all characters between the first index and last index, but does it?
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if indexOf returned the last position the string str was found in the current string, does it?
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if indexOf returned the last position the string str was found in the current string and if substring included all characters between the start and end index.  Check both of these.

   What is the value of s2 after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = new String("hi there");
     int pos = s1.indexOf("e");
     String s2 = s1.substring(0,pos);

   :practice: T
   :answer_a: Hi
   :answer_b: hi
   :answer_c: H
   :answer_d: h
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Strings are immutable, meaning they don't change.  Any method that changes a string returns a new string.  So s1 never changes.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s2 and it was substring(0,2) not (0,1)
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s2, not s1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s3, not s1.

   :feedback_b: How does substring work?  Does it include the character at the end index?
   :feedback_c: What does toLowerCase do?
   :feedback_d: s2 is set to just "H" and s3 is set to changing all characters in s2 to lower case.

   What is the value of s3 after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "Hi";
     String s2 = s1.substring(0,1);

   :answer_c: negative (< 0)
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: H is after B in the alphabet so s1 is greater than s2.
   :feedback_b: The method compareTo will only return 0 if the strings have the same characters in the same order.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was s2.compareTo(s1)

   What is the value of answer after the following code executes?

Common Mistakes with Strings

           getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", passed);
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

Here is a list of common mistakes made with Strings.


  -  Thinking that substrings include the character at the last index when they don't.

  -  Thinking that strings can change when they can't.  They are immutable.

  - Trying to access part of a string that is not between index 0 and length -1. This will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

  -  Trying to call a method like ``indexOf`` on a string reference that is null.  You will get a null pointer exception.

  -  Using ``==`` to test if two strings are equal.  This is actually a test to see if they refer to the same object.  Usually you only want to know if they have the same characters in the same order.  In that case you should use ``equals`` or ``compareTo`` instead.
  -  Treating upper and lower case characters the same in Java.  If ``s1 = "Hi"`` and ``s2 = "hi"`` then ``s1.equals(s2)`` is false.


|Groupwork| Programming Challenge : Pig Latin
----------------------------------------------

.. |pig| image:: Figures/pig.png

    :alt: pig latin

|pig| Can you speak Pig Latin? In Pig Latin, you take the first letter and put it at the end of the word and add the letters "ay" to the end. For example, "pig" becomes "igpay".

Create a program that takes a word and transforms it to Pig Latin using String methods. You may need the word's length, a substring that does not include the first letter, and a substring that is just the first letter (you can get the ith letter of a string using substring(i,i+1) so for example the letter at index 3 would be substring(3,4)).

Summary
-------------------

- **index** - A number that represents the position of a character in a string.  The first character in a string is at index 0.
- **length** - The number of characters in a string.
- **substring** - A new string that contains a copy of part of the original string.

- A String object has index values from 0 to length – 1. Attempting to access indices outside this range will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

- String objects are **immutable**, meaning that String methods do not change the String object. Any method that seems to change a string actually creates a new string.

- The following String methods and constructors, including what they do and when they are used, are part of the |AP CSA Reference Sheet| that you can use during the exam:

  - **String(String str)** : Constructs a new String object that represents the same sequence of characters as str.

  - **int length()** : returns the number of characters in a String object.

  - **String substring(int from, int to)** : returns the substring beginning at index from  and ending at index (to -1).

  - **String substring(int from)** : returns substring(from, length()).

  - **int indexOf(String str)** : searches for str in the current string and returns the index of the first occurrence of str; returns -1 if not found.

  - **boolean equals(String other)** : returns true if this (the calling object) is equal to other; returns false otherwise.

  - **int compareTo(String other)** : returns a value < 0 if this is less than other; returns zero if this is equal to other; returns a value > 0 if this is greater than other.

- ``str.substring(index, index + 1)`` returns a single character at index in string str.
