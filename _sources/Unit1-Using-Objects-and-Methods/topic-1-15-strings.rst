Strings
========


.. index::
   single: String
   single: object reference
   single: reference
   pair: String; definition


**Strings** in Java are objects of the ``String`` class. Strings represent sequences of characters and are used to store text like names, addresses, or messages.  The ``String`` class is part of the ``java.lang package`` which is available by default in all Java programs.

.. note::

   Class names in Java, like ``String``, begin with a capital letter.  All primitive types: ``int``, ``double``, and ``boolean``, begin with a lowercase letter.  This is one easy way to tell the difference between primitive types and class types.


.. activecode:: lcsb1

   Run the following code.  What does it print?
   ~~~~
   public class Test1
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           String greeting = null;
           System.out.println(greeting);
       }
   }

   public class RunestoneTests extends CodeTestHelper

       public void testMain() throws IOException
       {
           String output = getMethodOutput("main");
           String expect = "null";
           boolean passed = getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", true);
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

The code above declares an object variable named ``greeting`` and sets the value of greeting to the Java keyword ``null`` to show that it doesn't refer to any object yet.  So ``System.out.println(greeting);`` will print ``null``.

Object variables **refer** to objects in memory.  A reference is a way to find the actual object, like adding a contact to your phone lets you reach someone without knowing exactly where they are.  The value of greeting is null since the string object has not been created yet.

    Figure 1: Initial value for an object reference

.. index::
   pair: String; creation

In Java there are two ways to create an object of the ``String`` class.  You can use the ``new`` keyword followed by a space and then the class constructor and then in parentheses you can include values used to initialize the fields of the object.  This is the standard way to create a new object of a class in Java.

.. code-block:: java

   String greeting = new String("Hello");

.. index::
    single: String literal
    pair: String; literal


In Java you can also use just a **string literal**, which is a set of characters enclosed in double quotes (``"``), to create a ``String`` object.

.. code-block:: java

   String greeting = "Hello";

In both cases an object of the ``String`` class will be created in memory and the value of the variable greeting will be set to an object reference, a way to find that object.

   The code below creates two greeting strings: one using a string literal and the other using new and the String constructor. Change the code to add 2 new strings called firstName and lastName, one using a string literal and the other using new, and print them out with the greetings.

   public class StringTest
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           String greeting1 = "Hello!";
           String greeting2 = new String("Welcome!");
           System.out.println(greeting1);
           System.out.println(greeting2);
       }

            String origCode =
                    "public class StringTest {      public static void main(String[] args)      {"
                            + " String greeting1 = \"Hello!\";        String greeting2 = new"
                            + " String(\"Welcome!\"); System.out.println(greeting1);"
                            + " System.out.println(greeting2); }    }";
            boolean changed = codeChanged(origCode);

   Now that greeting refers to an actual object we can ask the object what class created it. Try the following.  What does it print?

       {
           String greeting = "Hello";
           Class currClass = greeting.getClass();
           System.out.println(currClass);
           Class parentClass = currClass.getSuperclass();
           System.out.println(parentClass);
       }
   }

   ====
   import static org.junit.Assert.*;

       public void testMain() throws IOException
       {
           String output = getMethodOutput("main");
           String expect = "class java.lang.String\nclass java.lang.Object";
           boolean passed = getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", true);
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

.. index::
   single: parent class
   single: superclass
   single: inheritance
   single: package
   single: java.lang
   pair: package; java.lang

The code above will first print class ``java.lang.String`` since ``greeting`` was created by the ``String`` class.  The full name for the ``String`` class is ``java.lang.String``.  The ``java.lang`` part is the **package** name.  Every class in the Java language is in a package and the standard classes like ``String`` are in the ``java.lang`` package.  Every object in Java knows the class that created it.  Also, every class knows its **parent** class.  Yes, a class can have a parent class, just as people have parents.  But, in Java a class can only have one parent.  A class can ``inherit`` object fields and methods from a parent class, just like you might inherit musical ability from a parent.  The last print statement will print ``class java.lang.Object`` because the parent class (**superclass**) of the String class is the Object class.  All classes in Java inherit from the Object class at some point in their ancestry.

String Operators - Concatenation
---------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: String; append

``String``\ s can be added to each other to create a new string using the ``+``
or ``+=`` operator . This is also called **concatenation**. You
can also add any other kind of value to a ``String`` with ``+`` or ``+=`` and
the other value will be converted to a ``String`` automatically. 

A String object is **immutable**, meaning once a String object is created, its attributes cannot be changed. So when we add two ``String``\ s (or a ``String`` and another
value converted to a ``String``) we get a new ``String`` without making any
change to the values being added together just like when we add the ints `1 + 2` the
original `1` and `2` aren't changed. When we use ``+=`` we are making a new
``String`` by adding something to the current value of a variable and then
assigning that new value back into the variable, again just like with numbers.

.. activecode:: lcso1
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest
   :practice: T

   Try the following code. Add another variable for a lastname that is "Hernandez". Use += or + to add the lastname variable after name to the result. Use += or + to add 2 more exclamation points (!) to the end of the happy birthday greeting in result.
   ~~~~
   public class Test1
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           String start = "Happy Birthday";
           String name = "Jose";
           String result = start + " " + name; // add together strings
           result += "!"; // add on to the same string
           System.out.println(result);
       }
   }

           String expect = "Happy Birthday Jose Hernandez!!!";
           boolean passed = getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main");
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

.. note::
   Note that spaces are not added between strings automatically.  If you want a space between two strings then add one using + " " +. If you forget to add spaces, you will get smushed output like "HiJose" instead of "Hi Jose".  And remember that variables are never put inside the quotes ("") since this would print the variable name out letter by letter instead of its value.

     String s1 = "xy";
     String s2 = s1;
     s1 = s1 + s2 + "z";


.. index::
   single: toString
   pair: Object; toString


You can even add other items to a ``String`` using the ``+`` operator. Primitive
values like ``int`` and ``boolean`` will be converted to a ``String`` automatically when concatenated with a ``String``.  Any other objects concatenated with a ``String`` will be converted to ``String`` using their
``toString`` method. All objects inherit a
``toString`` method from the ``Object`` class that returns a ``String`` representation of the object and many classes **override** it to produce a useful human-readable value. Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass, but the behavior of the method is specific to the subclass (overriding toString is no longer covered on the AP CSA exam).

           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

.. note::
   If you are appending a number to a string it will be converted to a string first before being appended.

Since the same operators are processed from left to right this will print ``1243``.  First 4 will be turned into a string and appended to 12 and then 3 will be turned into a string and appended to 124.  If you want to do addition instead, try using parentheses!

String Index and Length

.. index::
    pair: String; length
    pair: String; substring
    pair: String; indexOf
    pair: String; compareTo
    pair: String; equals
    pair: String; methods

A string holds characters in a sequence.  Each character is at a position or **index** which starts with 0 as shown below.  An **index** is a number associated with a position in a string.  The length of a string is the number of characters in it including any spaces or special characters.  The string below has a length of 14.

.. figure:: Figures/stringIndicies.png
    :width: 500px
    :align: center
    :alt: a string with the position (index) shown above each character
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 3: A string with the position (index) shown above each character

.. note::

   The first character in a string is at index 0 and the last characters is at **length** -1. Attempting to access indices outside this range will result in an **IndexOutOfBoundsException**.

String Methods
---------------

The ``String`` class includes many methods to process strings. For the AP CSA exam, you only need to know how to use the following String methods. Their descriptions are included in the |AP CSA Reference Sheet| that you get during the exam so you don't have to memorize these.


    -  **int length()** method returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters like punctuation.

    -  **String substring(int from, int to)** method returns a new string with the characters in the current string starting with the character at the ``from`` index and ending at the character *before* the ``to`` index (if the ``to`` index is specified, and if not specified it will contain the rest of the string).

    -  **int indexOf(String str)** method searches for the string ``str`` in the current string and returns the index of the beginning of ``str`` in the current string or -1 if it isn't found.

    -  **int compareTo(String other)** returns a negative value if the current string is less than the ``other`` string alphabetically, 0 if they have the same characters in the same order, and a positive value if the current string is greater than the ``other`` string alphabetically.

    -  **boolean equals(String other)** returns true when the characters in the current string are the same as the ones in the ``other`` string.  This method is inherited from the Object class, but is **overridden** which means that the String class has its own version of that method.


String Methods: length, substring, indexOf
-------------------------------------------

Run the code below to see the output from the String methods ``length``, ``substring``, and ``indexOf``. The length method returns the number of characters in the string, not the last index which is length -1. The ``str.substring(from,to)`` method returns the substring from the ``from`` index up to (but not including) the ``to`` index. The method ``str.indexOf(substring)`` searches for the substring in str and returns the index of where it finds substring in str or -1 if it is not there.

CompareTo and Equals
-----------------------

We can compare primitive types like int and double using operators like ``==`` and ``<`` or ``>``, which you will learn about in the next unit. However, with reference types like String, you must use the methods ``equals`` and ``compareTo``, not ``==`` or ``<`` or ``>``.

The method ``compareTo`` compares two strings character by character. If they are equal, it returns 0. If the first string is alphabetically ordered before the second string (which is the argument of ``compareTo``), it returns a negative number. And if the first string is alphabetically ordered after the second string, it returns a positive number. (The actual number that it returns does not matter, but it is the distance in the first letter that is different, e.g. A is 7 letters away from H.)

.. figure:: Figures/compareTo.png
    :width: 350px
    :align: center
    :alt: compareTo
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 4: compareTo returns a negative or positive value or 0 based on alphabetical order

The ``equals`` method compares the two strings character by character and returns ``true`` or ``false``. Both ``compareTo`` and ``equals`` are case-sensitive. There are case-insensitive versions of these methods, ``compareToIgnoreCase`` and ``equalsIgnoreCase``, which are not on the AP exam.

Run the example below to see the output from ``compareTo`` and ``equals``. Since ``"Hello!"`` would be alphabetically ordered after ``"And"``, ``compareTo`` returns a positive number. Since ``"Hello!"`` would be alphabetically ordered before ``"Zoo"``, ``compareTo`` returns a negative number.  Notice that ``equals`` is case-sensitive.

           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

Here is a list of common mistakes made with Strings.


  -  Thinking that substrings include the character at the last index when they don't.

  -  Thinking that strings can change when they can't.  They are immutable.

  - Trying to access part of a string that is not between index 0 and length -1. This will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

  -  Trying to call a method like ``indexOf`` on a string reference that is null.  You will get a null pointer exception.

  -  Using ``==`` to test if two strings are equal.  This is actually a test to see if they refer to the same object.  Usually you only want to know if they have the same characters in the same order.  In that case you should use ``equals`` or ``compareTo`` instead.
  -  Treating upper and lower case characters the same in Java.  If ``s1 = "Hi"`` and ``s2 = "hi"`` then ``s1.equals(s2)`` is false.


|Groupwork| Programming Challenge : Pig Latin
----------------------------------------------

.. |pig| image:: Figures/pig.png
    :width: 100
    :align: middle
    :alt: pig latin

|pig| Can you speak Pig Latin? In Pig Latin, you take the first letter and put it at the end of the word and add the letters "ay" to the end. For example, "pig" becomes "igpay".

Create a program that takes a word and transforms it to Pig Latin using String methods. You may need the word's length, a substring that does not include the first letter, and a substring that is just the first letter (you can get the ith letter of a string using substring(i,i+1) so for example the letter at index 3 would be substring(3,4)).



.. activecode:: challenge-PigLatin

   Write code in the pigLatin method below to use the substring method to transform a word given as its argument into Pig Latin where the first letter is put at the end and "ay" is added. The word pig is igpay in Pig Latin. Change the input below to try it on other words.

      public static String pigLatin(String word)

          // Change this to use word.substring to construct 
          // the pig latin version of word
          String pigLatin = word;

          return pigLatin;
      } 

      public static void main(String[] args)

Summary
-------------------

- A ``String`` object represents a sequence of characters and can be created by using a string literal.

- The ``String`` class is part of the ``java.lang`` package. Classes in the ``java.lang`` package are available by default.

- String objects can be created by using string literals (String s = "hi";) or by calling the String class constructor (String t = new String("bye");).

- A String object is immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its attributes cannot be changed. Methods called on a String object do not change the content of the String object.

- Two String objects can be concatenated together or combined using the + or += operator, resulting in a new String object. 

- A primitive value can be concatenated with a String object. This causes the implicit conversion of the primitive value to a String object.

- A String object can be concatenated with any object, which implicitly calls the object’s ``toString`` method (a behavior which is guaranteed to exist by the inheritance relationship every class has with the Object class). An object’s ``toString`` method returns a string value representing the object. Subclasses of Object often **override** the toString method with class-specific implementation. Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass, but the behavior of the method is specific to the subclass. Overriding the ``toString`` method of a class is outside the scope of the AP CSA exam.

- **index** - A number that represents the position of a character in a string.  The first character in a string is at index 0.
- **length** - The number of characters in a string.
- **substring** - A new string that contains a copy of part of the original string.

- A String object has index values from 0 to one less than the length of the string. Attempting to access indices outside this range will result in an ``IndexOutOfBoundsException``.


- The following String methods and constructors, including what they do and when they are used, are part of the |AP CSA Reference Sheet| that you can use during the exam:

  - **String(String str)** : Constructs a new String object that represents the same sequence of characters as str.

  - **int length()** : returns the number of characters in a String object.

  - **String substring(int from, int to)** : returns the substring beginning at index from  and ending at index (to -1).

  - **String substring(int from)** : returns substring(from, length()).

  - **int indexOf(String str)** : searches for str in the current string and returns the index of the first occurrence of str; returns -1 if not found.

  - **boolean equals(String other)** : returns true if this (the calling object) is equal to other; returns false otherwise. Using the equals method to compare one String object with an object of a type other than String is outside the scope of the AP CSA exam.

  - **int compareTo(String other)** : returns a value < 0 if this is less than other; returns zero if this is equal to other; returns a value > 0 if this is greater than other. Strings are ordered based upon the alphabet.

- ``str.substring(index, index + 1)`` returns a single character at index in string ``str``.

AP Practice
-------------

.. mchoice:: AP-substring
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: hi th
   :answer_b: hi the
   :answer_c: hi ther
   :answer_d: hi there
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The substring method returns the string starting at the first index and not including the last index.  The method indexOf returns the index of the first place the string occurs.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if substring returned all characters between the first index and last index, but does it?
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if indexOf returned the last position the string str was found in the current string, does it?
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if indexOf returned the last position the string str was found in the current string and if substring included all characters between the start and end index.  Check both of these.

   What is the value of s2 after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = new String("hi there");
     int pos = s1.indexOf("e");
     String s2 = s1.substring(0,pos);

.. mchoice:: AP-immutable
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: Hi
   :answer_b: hi
   :answer_c: H
   :answer_d: h
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Strings are immutable, meaning they don't change.  Any method that changes a string returns a new string.  So s1 never changes.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s2 and it was substring(0,2) not (0,1)
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s2, not s1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s3, not s1.

   What is the value of s1 after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "Hi";
     String s2 = s1.substring(0,1);
     String s3 = s2.toLowerCase();


.. note::

   Strings are **immutable** which means that they can't change. Anything that you do to modify a string (like creating a substring or appending strings) returns a new string. The original string is not changed.
