Assignment and Input
=====================================

Assignment Statements
---------------------

**Assignment statements** initialize or change the value stored in a variable using the assignment operator ``=``.  An assignment statement always has a single variable on the left hand side. The value of the **expression** (which can contain math operators and other variables) on the right of the ``=`` sign is assigned to and stored in the variable on the left side.

    Figure 1: Assignment Statement (variable = expression;)

Instead of saying equals for the = in an assignment statement, say "gets" or "is assigned" to remember that the variable gets or is assigned the value on the right. In the figure above score is assigned the value of the expression 10 times points (which is another variable) plus 5.

As we saw in the video, we can set one variable's value to a *copy* of the value of another variable like ``y = x;``.  This won't change the value of the variable that you are copying from.

Data Types in Assignments
--------------------------

Every variable must be assigned a value before it can be used in an expression. That value must be from a compatible data type. A variable is **initialized** the first time it is assigned a value. During execution, an expression is evaluated to produce a single value. The value of an expression has a type based on the types of the values and operators evaluated in the expression. For example, an arithmetic expression that uses at least one ``double`` value will evaluate
to a ``double`` value and must be saved in a ``double`` variable, as seen in the exercise below. In the next lesson, we will see how to change a variable or expression from one type to another.

   The code below looks okay at first glance, but if you run it, you will see that there is an error of incompatible types. Change the data type of one of the variables to fix the error.

       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
             int x = 1;
             double y = 2.2;
             x = 2 * y;
             System.out.println(x);
       }
   }

   public class RunestoneTests extends CodeTestHelper
   {
       @Test
       public void test1()
       {
           String output = getMethodOutput("main");
           String expect = "4.4\n";
           boolean passed =
                   getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main");
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }


Reference types like ``String`` can be assigned a new object or null if there is no object. The literal **null** is a special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any object.

.. code-block:: java

      // String variables can be assigned null 
      // or a new String object
      String str = null;
      str = "new object";   

Adding 1 to a Variable
-------------------------

If you use a variable to keep score, you would probably increment it (add one to
the current value) whenever score should go up. You can do this by setting the
variable to the current value of the variable plus one (``score = score + 1``)
as shown below. The formula would look strange in math class, but it
makes sense in coding because it is assigning a new value to the variable on the
left that comes from evaluating the arithmetic expression on the right. So, the
score variable is set to the previous value of score plus 1.

.. activecode:: incrementScore
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest

   Try the code below to see how score is incremented by 1. Try substituting 2 instead of 1 to see what happens.
   ~~~~
   public class Test1
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           int score = 0;
           System.out.println(score);
           score = score + 1;

Variables are a powerful abstraction in programming because the same algorithm can be used with different input values saved in variables.  Input can come in a variety of forms, such as **tactile** for example by clicking on a button, **audio** with speech, **visual** using a webcam, or the most common form, **text** that the user types in. The ``Scanner`` class in Java is one way to obtain text input from the keyboard.

The code below using the ``Scanner`` class will say hello to anyone who types in their name and will have different results for different name values. First, type in your name below the code and then click on run. Try again with a friend's name. The code works for any name: behold, the power of variables!

.. activecode:: inputName
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest

   The code below will say hello to anyone who types in their name.  Type in your name below and then click on run.  Try again with a friend's name.

   import java.util.Scanner;

   public class Main 
   {
       public static void main(String[] args) 
       {
           System.out.println("Please type in a name in the input box below.");
           Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
           String name = scan.nextLine();
           System.out.println("Hello " + name);
           scan.close();
        }
    }

       @Test
       public void test1()

           //String output = getMethodOutput("main");
           boolean passed =
                   getResults("", "", "Scanner example", true);
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

Although you will not be tested in the AP CSA exam on using the Java input from the keyboard, learning how to do input in Java is very useful and fun. For more information on using the ``Scanner`` class, go to https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp, and for the newer ``Console`` class, https://howtodoinjava.com/java-examples/console-input-output/. We are limited with the one way communication with the Java server in this Runestone ebook, but in most IDEs, the input/output would be more interactive. You can try this |JavaIOExampleJuiceMind| (click on Create Starter Code after login with a Google account) or |JavaIOExampleReplit| using the ``Scanner`` class and |JavaIOConsoleReplit| using the ``Console`` class. We will also learn how to use ``Scanner`` with input files in a later unit.  

|Groupwork| Coding Challenge : Dog Years
------------------------------------------------

In this coding challenge, you will calculate your age, and your pet's age from your birthdates, and your pet's age in dog years.   In the code below, type in the current year, the year you were born, the year your dog or cat was born (if you don't have one, make one up!) in the variables below. Then write formulas in assignment statements to calculate how old you are, how old your dog or cat is, and how old they are in dog years which is 7 times a human year.  Finally, print it all out. If you are pair programming, switch drivers (who has control of the keyboard in pair programming) after every line of code.

Summary
-------------------

- (AP 1.4.A.2) The **assignment operator** (``=``) allows a program to initialize or change the
  value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is stored in the variable on the left.

- (AP 1.4.A.1) Every variable must be assigned a value before it can be used in an expression. That value must be from a compatible data type. 

- (AP 1.4.A.1) A variable is **initialized** the first time it is assigned a value. 

- (AP 1.4.A.1) Reference types can be assigned a new object or ``null`` if there is no object. The literal ``null`` is a special value used to indicate that a reference is not associated with any object.

- (AP 1.4.A.3) During execution, an expression is evaluated to produce a single value. The value of an expression has a type based on the types of the values and operators used in the expression.

- (AP 1.4.B.1) Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. The ``Scanner`` class is one way to obtain text input from the keyboard, although input from the keyboard will not be on the AP exam. 

AP Practice

.. mchoice:: apcsa_sample1
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: 8
   :answer_b: 8.0
   :answer_c: 10.5
   :answer_d: An incompatible type error will occur.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Don't forget that the result will be a double since at least 1 double value is involved.
   :feedback_b: Yes, this is equivalent to (5 + ((a/b)*c) - 1) using int division.
   :feedback_c: Don't forget that division and multiplication will be done first due to operator precedence, and that an int/int gives an int truncated result where everything to the right of the decimal point is dropped.
   :feedback_d: No error will occur since the double result is saved in a double.

   Consider the following code segment.

   .. code-block:: java

       int a = 5;
       int b = a/2;
       double c = a/2.0;
       double d = 5 + a / b * c - 2;
