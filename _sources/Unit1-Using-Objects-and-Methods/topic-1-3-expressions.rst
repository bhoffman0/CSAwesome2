Expressions and Assignment Statements
=====================================

***Divide into 2: 1.3 Expressions and 1.4 Assignment Statements*** 

In this lesson, you will learn about assignment statements and expressions that contain math operators and variables.

Assignment Statements
---------------------

**Assignment statements** initialize or change the value stored in a variable using the assignment operator ``=``.  An assignment statement always has a single variable on the left hand side. The value of the **expression** (which can contain math operators and other variables) on the right of the ``=`` sign is stored in the variable on the left.

    Figure 1: Assignment Statement (variable = expression;)

Instead of saying equals for the = in an assignment statement, say "gets" or "is assigned" to remember that the variable gets or is assigned the value on the right. In the figure above score is assigned the value of the expression 10 times points (which is another variable) plus 5.

As we saw in the video, we can set one variable's value to a *copy* of the value of another variable like ``y = x;``.  This won't change the value of the variable that you are copying from.

Adding 1 to a Variable
-------------------------

If you use a variable to keep score, you would probably increment it (add one to
the current value) whenever score should go up. You can do this by setting the
variable to the current value of the variable plus one (``score = score + 1``)
as shown below. The formula would look strange in math class, but it
makes sense in coding because it is assigning a new value to the variable on the
left that comes from evaluating the arithmetic expression on the right. So, the
score variable is set to the previous value of score plus 1.

.. activecode:: lccv1

   Try the code below to see how score is incremented by 1. Try substituting 2 instead of 1 to see what happens.

Variables are a powerful abstraction in programming because the same algorithm can be used with different input values saved in variables.  The code below (|JavaIOExample| using the ``Scanner`` class or |JavaIOConsole| using the ``Console`` class) will say hello to anyone who types in their name for different name values. Click on run and then type in your name. Then, try run again and type in a friend's name. The code works for any name: behold, the power of variables!

Although you will not be tested in the AP CSA exam on using the Java input or the ``Scanner`` or ``Console`` classes, learning how to do input in Java is very useful and fun.

Operators
---------


.. index::
    single: operators
    pair: math; operators
    pair: operators; addition
    pair: operators; subtraction
    pair: operators; multiplication
    pair: operators; division
    pair: operators; equality
    pair: operators; inequality

Java uses the standard mathematical operators for addition (``+``), subtraction
(``-``), and division (``/``). The multiplication operator is written as ``*``, as
it is in most programming languages, since the character sets used until
relatively recently didn’t have a character for a real multiplication sign,
``×``, and keyboards still don’t have a key for it. Likewise no ``÷``.

You may be used to using ``^`` for exponentiation, either from a graphing
calculator or tools like Desmos. Confusingly ``^`` *is* an operator in Java,
but it has a completely different meaning than exponentiation and isn’t even
exactly an arithmetic operator. You will learn how to use the  ``Math.pow`` method to do exponents in Unit 2.

Arithmetic expressions can be of type ``int`` or ``double``. An arithmetic
expression consisting only of ``int`` values will evaluate to an ``int`` value.
An arithmetic expression that uses at least one ``double`` value will evaluate
to a ``double`` value. (You may have noticed that ``+`` was also used to combine
``String`` and other values into new ``String``\ s. More on this when we talk
about ``String``\ s more fully in Unit 2.)

Java uses the operator ``==`` to test if the value on the left is equal to the
value on the right and ``!=`` to test if two items are not equal. Don't get one
equal sign ``=`` confused with two equal signs ``==``. They mean very different
things in Java. One equal sign is used to assign a value to a variable. Two
equal signs are used to test a variable to see if it is a certain value and that
returns true or false as you'll see below. Also note that using ``==`` and
``!=`` with ``double`` values can produce surprising results. Because ``double``
values are only an approximation of the real numbers even things that should be
mathematically equivalent might not be represented by the exactly same
``double`` value and thus will not be ``==``. To see this for yourself, write a
line of code below to print the value of the expression ``0.3 == 0.1 + 0.2``; it
will be ``false``!

           System.out.println(2 * 3);
           System.out.println(2 / 3);
           // == is to test while = is to assign
           System.out.println(2 == 3);
           System.out.println(2 != 3);
       }
   }

           String expect = "5\n-1\n6\n0\nfalse\ntrue";
           boolean passed =
                   getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main", true);
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

.. note::

   When Java sees you doing integer division (or any operation with integers) it
   assumes you want an integer result so it throws away anything after the
   decimal point in the answer. This is called **truncating division**. If you
   need a double answer, you should make at least one of the values in the
   expression a double like 2.0.


With division, another thing to watch out for is dividing by 0. An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an **ArithmeticException** error message. Try it in one of the active code windows above.

Operators can be used to create compound expressions with more than one operator. You can either use a literal value which is a fixed value like 2, or variables in them.  When compound expressions are evaluated, **operator precedence** rules are used, just like when we do math (remember PEMDAS?), so that ``*``, ``/``, and ``%`` are done before ``+`` and ``-``. However, anything in parentheses is done first. It doesn't hurt to put in extra parentheses if you are unsure as to what will be done first or just to make it more clear.

           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

The Remainder Operator
----------------------

The operator ``%`` in Java is the **remainder** operator. Like the other
arithmetic operators is takes two operands. Mathematically it returns the
remainder after dividing the first number by the second, using truncating integer division. 
For instance, ``5 % 2`` evaluates to 1 since 2 goes into 5 two times
with a remainder of 1.

While you may not have heard of remainder as an operator, think back to
elementary school math. Remember when you first learned long division, before
they taught you about decimals, how when you did a long division that didn’t
divide evenly, you gave the answer as the number of even divisions and the
remainder. That remainder is what is returned by this operator. In the figures
below, the remainders are the same values that would be returned by ``2 % 3``
and ``5 % 2``.

.. figure:: Figures/mod-py.png
    :width: 150px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 1: Long division showing the integer result and the remainder

Sometimes people—including Professor Lewis in the next video—will call ``%``
the **modulo**, or **mod**, operator. That is not actually correct though the
difference between remainder and modulo, which uses Euclidean division instead 
of truncating integer division, only matters when negative operands are involved 
and the signs of the operands differ. With positive operands, remainder and mod give the same results. 
Java does have a method ``Math.floorMod`` in the ``Math`` class if you need to use modulo instead of remainder, but ``%`` is all you need in the AP exam.

.. note::
   The result of x % y when x is smaller than y is always x.  The value y can't go into x at all (goes in 0 times), since x is smaller than y, so the result is just x.  So if you see 2 % 3 the result is 2.

In this programming challenge, you will calculate your age, and your pet's age from your birthdates, and your pet's age in dog years.   In the code below, type in the current year, the year you were born, the year your dog or cat was born (if you don't have one, make one up!) in the variables below. Then write formulas in assignment statements to calculate how old you are, how old your dog or cat is, and how old they are in dog years which is 7 times a human year.  Finally, print it all out. If you are pair programming, switch drivers (who has control of the keyboard in pair programming) after every line of code.

Your teacher may suggest that you use a Java IDE like |repl| for this challenge so that you can use input to get these values using the |Scanner|. Here is a |repl template| that you can use to get started if you want to try the challenge with input.

Summary
-------------------

- Arithmetic expressions include expressions of type ``int`` and ``double``.

- The arithmetic operators consist of ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` , ``/``, and ``%``
  also known as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.

- An arithmetic operation that uses two ``int`` values will evaluate to an
  ``int`` value. With integer division, any decimal part in the result will be
  thrown away.

- An arithmetic operation that uses at least one ``double`` value will evaluate
  to a ``double`` value.

- Operators can be used to construct compound expressions.

- During evaluation, operands are associated with operators according to
  **operator precedence** to determine how they are grouped. (``*``, ``/``,
  ``%`` have precedence over ``+`` and ``-``, unless parentheses are used to
  group those.)

- An attempt to divide an integer by zero will result in an ``ArithmeticException``.

- The assignment operator (``=``) allows a program to initialize or change the
  value stored in a variable. The value of the expression on the right is stored
  in the variable on the left.

- During execution, expressions are evaluated to produce a single value.

- The value of an expression has a type based on the types of the values and
  operators used in the expression.

AP Practice
------------

The following is a 2019 AP CSA sample question.

.. mchoice:: apcsa_sample1
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: 0.666666666666667
   :answer_b: 9.0
   :answer_c: 10.0
   :answer_d: 11.5
   :answer_e: 14.0
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Don't forget that division and multiplication will be done first due to operator precedence.
   :feedback_b: Don't forget that division and multiplication will be done first due to operator precedence.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this is equivalent to (5 + ((a/b)*c) - 1).
   :feedback_d: Don't forget that division and multiplication will be done first due to operator precedence, and that an int/int gives an int truncated result where everything to the right of the decimal point is dropped.
   :feedback_e: Don't forget that division and multiplication will be done first due to operator precedence.

   Consider the following code segment.

   .. code-block:: java

       int a = 5;
       int b = 2;
       double c = 3.0;
       System.out.println(5 + a / b * c - 1);

   What is printed when the code segment is executed?
