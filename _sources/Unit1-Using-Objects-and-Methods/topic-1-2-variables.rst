Variables and Data Types
========================

What is a Variable?
-------------------

.. index::
   single: variable

A **variable** is a memory location in the computer that can store a value that can change or vary while the program is running. The following `video <https://youtu.be/pHgYlVjagmA>`_ explains what a variable is and gives some real word examples of variables.

For example, when you play a game, it will often have a score.  Scores often start at 0 and increase, so they can change.  A score can be stored in a variable.

Data Types
----------

.. index::
   single: integer
   single: int
   single: double
   single: boolean
   single: String
   pair: variable; types
   pair: variable; primitive type
   pair: variable; object type
   pair: variable; integer
   pair: variable; floating point
   pair: variable; Boolean
   pair: variable; String

Every variable has a name and a data type that determines the kind of data it can hold. There are two types of variables in Java: **primitive variables** that hold values of primitive types like numbers and **reference variables** that hold a reference to a more complex object.  A reference is a way to find the object (like a UPS tracking number helps you find your package).  

The primitive types on the Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam are:

- ``int`` which can represent integers, i.e. numbers with no fractional part
  such as 3, 0, -76, and 20393.

- ``double`` which can represent non-integer numbers like 6.3 -0.9, and
  60293.93032. Computer people call these “floating point” numbers because the
  decimal point “floats” relative to the magnitude of the number, similar to the
  way it does in scientific notation like :math:`6.5 ✕ 10^8`. The name
  ``double`` comes from the fact that ``double``\s are represented using 64
  bits, double the 32 bits used for the type ``float`` which used to be the
  normal size floating point number when most computers did math in units of
  32-bits. (``float`` is rarely used these days and is not part of the AP
  curriculum.)

- ``boolean`` which can represent only two values: ``true`` and ``false``. (The
  data type is named for `George Boole
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole>`_, a 19th century English
  mathematician who invented Boolean algebra, a system for dealing with
  statements made up of only true and false values.)

``String`` is one of the object types on the exam and is the name of a class in
Java. A ``String`` is written in a Java program as a sequence of characters
enclosed in a pair of double quotes - like ``"Hello"``. You will learn more
about ``String`` objects later.

A data type is a set of values (a domain) and a set of operations on them. For example, you can do addition operations with ``int``\s and ``double``\s but not with ``boolean``\s and ``String``\s.

Declaring Variables in Java
---------------------------

.. index::
   single: bit
   single: binary digit
   single: declare
   pair: variable; declare


To create a variable, you must tell Java its data type and its name.  Creating a variable is also called **declaring a variable**.  The type is a keyword like int, double, or boolean, but you get to make up the name for the variable.  When you create a **primitive variable** Java will set aside enough bits in memory for that primitive type and associate that memory location with the name that you used.

Computers store all values using **bits** (binary digits).  A **bit** can represent two values and we usually say that the value of a bit is either 0 or 1. When you declare a variable, you have to tell Java the type of the variable because Java needs to know how many bits to use and how to represent the value.  The 3 different primitive types
all require different number of bits.  An integer gets 32 bits of memory, a double gets 64 bits of memory and a boolean could be represented by just one bit.

.. figure:: Figures/typesAndSpace.png
    :width: 500px
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 2: Examples of variables with names and values.  Notice that the different types get a different amount of memory space.

To **declare** (create) a variable, you  specify the type, leave at least one space, then the name for the variable and end the line with a semicolon (``;``). Java uses the keyword **int** for integer, **double** for a floating point number (a double precision number), and **boolean** for a Boolean value (true or false).

Here is an example declaration of a variable called score.

.. code-block:: java

  int score;

After declaring a variable, you can give it a value like below using an equals sign ``=`` followed by the value.

.. code-block:: java

  int score;
  score = 4;

Or you can set an initial value for the variable in the variable declaration. Here is an example that shows declaring a variable and initializing it all in a single statement.

.. code-block:: java

  int score = 4;

When you are printing out variables, you can use the **string concatenation** operator ``+`` to add them to another string inside System.out.print. Never put variables inside quotes ``""`` because that will print out the variable name letter by letter. You do not want to print out the variable name, but the value of the variable in memory. If you're not sure what this means, try putting quotes around the variable and see what happens. In the print out, if you want spaces between words and variables, you must put the space in the quotes. If you forget to add spaces, you will get smushed output like "HiJose" instead of "Hi Jose".

           boolean won = false;
           System.out.println(won);
           won = true;
           System.out.println(won);

           String name = "Jose";
           System.out.println("Hi " + name);
       }

           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

.. note::

    Variables are never put inside quotes ("") in System.out.print statements. This would print the variable name out letter by letter instead of printing its value.

Here it means set the value in the memory location associated with the variable name on the left to a *copy* of the value on the right. The first line above sets the value in the box called score to 4.  A variable always has to be on the left side of the ``=`` and a value or expression on the right.

.. fillintheblank:: fillDecVar1

   Fill in the following: [blank] age = [blank]; to declare age to be an integer and set its value to 5.

   -    :int: Correct.  You typically use whole numbers for ages after age 1.
        :.*: Remember that Java uses just the first 3 letters of integer
   -    :5: Correct.  You can initialize to a value.
        :.*: Use 5 in the second blank

.. fillintheblank:: fillDecVar2

   What type should you use for a shoe size like 8.5?

   -    :^\s*double$: Correct.  Any variable that needs to values after the decimal point should be declared as a double.
        :.*: What type allows for a decimal value

.. fillintheblank:: fillDecVar3

   What type should you use for a number of tickets?

   -    :^\s*int$: Correct. You can't buy half a ticket so this will be an integer.

   =====
   Double temp = 101.2;  #paired
   =====
   boolean hasInsurance = false;
   =====
   Boolean hasInsurance = false; #paired




Naming Variables
--------------------

.. index::
   pair: variable; names

While you can name your variable almost anything, there are some rules.  A variable name should start with an alphabetic character (like a, b, c, etc.) and can include letters, numbers, and underscores ``_``. It must be all one word with no spaces.

You can't use any of the keywords or reserved words as variable names in Java (``for``, ``if``, ``class``, ``static``, ``int``, ``double``, etc).  For a complete list of keywords and reserved words, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.9.

The name of the variable should describe the data it holds.  A name like ``score`` helps make your code easier to read. A name like ``x`` is not a good variable name in programming, because it gives no clues as to what kind of data it holds.  Do not name
your variables crazy things like ``thisIsAReallyLongName``, especially on the AP exam. You want to make your code easy to understand, not harder.

.. note::


    - Use meaningful variable names!
    - Start variable names with a lower case letter and use camelCase.
    - Variable names are case-sensitive and spelling sensitive! Each use of the variable in the code must match the variable name in the declaration exactly.
    - Never put variables inside quotes (" ").

.. index::
    single: camel case
    pair: variable; naming convention

The convention in Java and many programming languages is to always start a variable name with a lower case letter and then uppercase the first letter of each additional word, for example ``gameScore``. Variable names can not include spaces so uppercasing the first letter of each additional word makes it easier to read the name.  Uppercasing the first letter of each additional word is called **camel case** because it looks like the humps of a camel. Another option is to use underscore ``_`` to separate words, but you cannot have spaces in a variable name.



.. activecode:: varCaseSensitive
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest

   Java is case sensitive so ``gameScore`` and ``gamescore`` are not the same.  Run and fix the code below to use the right variable name.
   ~~~~
   public class CaseSensitiveClass
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           int gameScore = 0; // variable name using camel case
           // this is using a different variable without camel case!
           System.out.println("gameScore is " + gamescore);

Summary
-------------------


- (AP 1.2.B.2)	A **variable** is a memory storage location that holds a value, which can change while the program is running.  

- (AP 1.2.B.2) Every variable has a name and an associated data type that determines the kind of data it can hold. A variable of a primitive type holds a primitive value from that type.

- A variable can be declared and initialized with the following code:

.. code-block:: java

- (AP 1.2.A.1) A **data type** is a set of values and a corresponding set of operations on those values. Data types can be primitive types (like int) or reference types (like String). 

- (AP 1.2.A.2) The **primitive** data types used in this course define the set of values and corresponding operations on those values for numbers and Boolean values.

- (AP 1.2.A.3) A **reference** type, like String, is used to define objects that are not primitive types.

- (AP 1.2.B.1) The three primitive data types used in this course are **int** (integer numbers), **double** (decimal numbers), and **boolean** (true or false).

- ``String`` is a reference data type representing a sequence of characters.

   :practice: T
   :answer_a: int GPA; int numStudents;
   :answer_b: double GPA; int numStudents;
   :answer_c: double GPA; double numStudents;
   :answer_d: int GPA; boolean numStudents;
   :answer_e: double GPA; boolean numStudents;
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The average grade in GPA could be a decimal number like 3.5.
   :feedback_b: Yes, the average grade could be a decimal number, and the number of students is an integer.
   :feedback_c: The number of students is an integer number. Although it could be saved in a double, an int would be more appropriate.
   :feedback_d: The average grade in GPA could be a decimal number like 3.5. Booleans hold a true or false value, not numbers.
   :feedback_e: Booleans hold a true or false value, not numbers.

   Which of the following pairs of declarations are the most appropriate to store a student’s average course grade in the variable GPA and the number of students in the variable numStudents?
