APIs and Libraries
=====================================

We have been using the ``System.out.println()`` method to print to the screen. This method is part of the Java **API (Application Programming Interface)**. A **method** is a block of code that performs a specific task. APIs are connected to **libraries** which are collections of classes written by other programmers that provide a set of methods that can be used to perform specific tasks. An API specification tells the programmer how to use those classes in a library. 

APIs and libraries are essential to programming because they allow you to use code that has already been written by others. This saves you time and allows you to focus on the specific task you are trying to accomplish.

Classes in the APIs and libraries are grouped into packages. A **package** is a collection of related classes and interfaces (which are similar to classes) that can be **imported** into a program to be used. A package is like a folder in a library's file directory and is used to avoid name conflicts. Later on, we will learn to ``import`` other Java packages to use in our code, but there is a package that is already built into Java called ``java.lang``. 

The ``java.lang`` package contains built-in classes and interfaces that are fundamental to the Java programming language, such as the ``String`` class and the ``System`` class. Take a look at the documentation for the ``java.lang`` package at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html. Can you find the ``System`` class in the documentation?

**Documentation** found in API specifications and libraries is essential to understanding the attributes and behaviors of a class defined by the API. Let's take a look at the ``System`` class documentation at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html.

The ``System`` class is part of the ``java.lang`` package in the Java API, and it has a number of methods that allow you to interact with your computer's operating system.
**Classes** are the building blocks of Java and object-oriented programming. A class defines a specific reference type. Existing classes and class libraries can be utilized to create objects. Let's look again at the documentation for the ``System`` class below. It is divided into Fields and Methods.

**Attributes** (or **fields**) refer to the data related to the class and are stored in variables. **Behaviors** refer to what instances of the class can do (or what can be done with it) and are defined by methods. We will learn more about these in the next lessons.

The ``System`` class has three fields/attributes: ``in``, ``out``, and ``err``. The ``out`` attribute is the output stream we use in ``System.out.println()`` and an instance of the ``PrintStream`` class, documented at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html. The ``PrintStream`` class has the method ``println()`` that we use to print to the screen. How many ``println()`` methods are there in the PrintStream class?  One for each type that it can print!

How can you tell attributes and methods apart when you look at library documentation? One easy way is that methods will always have parentheses after them, for example ``println()``, where you can put in the information (the arguments) that it needs to do its job. Attributes are variables and will not have parentheses after them. 

Notice that you use the . (dot) operator to access attributes and methods of a class. For example, you use ``System.out`` to access the ``out`` attribute of the ``System`` class and ``System.out.println()`` to access the ``println()`` method of the ``PrintStream`` class.  In later lessons, you will learn more about arguments and return values of methods, and you will learn to write your own classes and methods.

|Groupwork| Challenge  
------------------------

Work in pairs (or independently if instructed by your teacher) to answer the following questions about APIs and libraries referring to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html. Make sure that you can identify the attributes and behaviors of a class found in the libraries contained in an API.
