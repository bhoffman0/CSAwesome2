Creating and Initializing Objects: Constructors
================================================

.. index::
   pair: class; constructor
   single: constructors
   single: new
   
A Java class defines what objects of the class know (attributes) and what they can do (behaviors).  Each class has **constructors** which are used to initialize the attributes in a newly created object. **Constructors** have the same name as the class.

A new object is created with the ``new`` keyword followed by the class name which is a call to the constructor (``new ClassName()``).  For example, ``new World()`` creates and initializes a new object of the ``World`` class, and ``new Turtle(habitat)`` creates and initializes a new ``Turtle`` object in the World habitat. The new object is saved in a variable of a **reference type** which holds an object reference or ``null`` if there is no object.

.. code-block:: java

    // To create a new object and call a constructor write:
    // ClassName variableName = new ClassName(arguments);
    World habitat = new World();    // create a new World object
    Turtle t = new Turtle(habitat); // create a new Turtle object

The World Class Constructors
----------------------------------------------------------

There can be more than one constructor defined in a class. This is called **overloading** the constructor. The ``World`` class has the 2 constructors seen below. One doesn't take any arguments and creates a default sized world and one takes the worldâ€™s width and height arguments to create a world of a specific size. An **argument** is a value that is passed into a constructor. Arguments are used to initialize the attributes of an object, in this case, the size of the world.

.. figure:: Figures/worldConstructors.png
    :width: 350px
    :align: center
    :alt: Two World constructors
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 1: Two World constructors

The **no-argument constructor** ``World()``, with no arguments inside the parentheses following the name of the constructor, creates a graphical window with a default size of 640x480 pixels. No-argument constructors usually set the attributes of the object to default values. The second ``World(int width, int height)`` constructor takes two integer arguments, and initializes the ``World`` object's width and height to them, for example ``new World(300,400)`` creates a 300x400 pixel world. 

.. code-block:: java

    World world1 = new World(); // creates a default size 640x480 world
    World world2 = new World(300,400); // creates a 300x400 world

   :feedback_a: This declares a variable w that refers to a World object, but it doesn't create a World object or initialize it.
   :feedback_b: You must include parentheses () to call a constructor.
   :feedback_c: Correct, use the new keyword followed by the classname and parentheses to create a new object and call the constructor.
   :feedback_d: You must use the new keyword to create a new object.
   :feedback_e: Correct, this constructor call creates a new World object with the size 300x500 pixels.

   Which of these is valid syntax for creating and initializing a World object?

   :feedback_a: For a constructor to be overloaded there must be more than one constructor.
   :feedback_b: For a constructor to be overloaded there must be more than one constructor.
   :feedback_c: For a constructor to be overloaded there must be more than one constructor.
   :feedback_d: Overloading means that there is more than one constructor.  The parameter lists must differ in either number, order, or type of parameters.

   Which of these is overloading the constructor?

The Turtle Class Constructors
----------------------------------------------------------

The ``Turtle`` class also has multiple constructors, although it always requires a world as a argument in order to have a place to draw the turtle. The default location for the turtle is right in the middle of the world.

There is another ``Turtle`` constructor that places the turtle at a certain (x,y) location in the world, for example at the coordinate (50, 100) below.

.. code-block:: java

    Turtle t1 = new Turtle(world1);
    Turtle t2 = new Turtle(50, 100, world1);

.. note::
   Notice that the order of the arguments matter. The ``Turtle`` constructor takes ``(x,y,world)`` as arguments in that order. If you mix up the order of the arguments it will cause an error, because the arguments will not be the data types that it expects. This is one reason why programming languages have data types -- to allow for error-checking.

   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: You must use the new keyword to create a new Turtle.
   :feedback_b: All turtle constructors take a world as an argument.
   :feedback_c: The order of the parameters matter, so this would cause a syntax error.
   :feedback_d: This creates a new Turtle object in the passed world at location (100,100)

   Which of these is valid syntax for creating and initializing a Turtle object in world1?

Object Variables and References
---------------------------------

.. index::
   single: reference
   single: null

New objects are saved in variables of a **reference type** which holds a reference to an object. A **reference** is a way to find the object in memory. It is like a tracking number that you can use to track the location of a package in the mail.

A special reference value **null** (which means none) can be used when a variable doesn't refer to any object. For instance, you can declare a variable and initialize it to **null** (``Turtle t1 = null;``) meaning the variable doesn't refer to any object yet.

.. |video1| raw:: html

   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fpjgXAV2BU&list=PLHqz-wcqDQIEP6p1_0wOb9l9aQ0qFijrP&ab_channel=colleenlewis" target="_blank">video</a>

Watch the |video1| below about null.

.. youtube:: 5fpjgXAV2BU
    :width: 650
    :height: 415
    :align: center

The code ``Turtle t1 = null;`` creates a variable ``t1`` that refers to a ``Turtle`` object, but the ``null`` means that it doesn't refer to an object yet. You could later create the object and set the object variable to refer to that new object (``t1 = new Turtle(world1)``).  Or more commonly, you can declare an object variable and initialize it in the same line of code (``Turtle t2 = new Turtle(world1);``).

.. code-block:: java

    World world1 = new World();
    Turtle t1 = null;
    t1 = new Turtle(world1);
    // declare and initialize t2
    Turtle t2 = new Turtle(world1);



Constructor Signatures

.. |turtle documentation| raw:: html

   <a href="https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/doc/Turtle.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">documentation</a>

When you use a class that someone has already written for you in a **library** that you can import like the ``Turtle`` class above, you can look up how to use the constructors and methods in the |turtle documentation| for that class.  The documentation will list the **signatures** (or headers) of the constructors or methods which will tell you their name and parameter list. The **parameter list**, in the **header** of a constructor, is an ordered list of variable declarations  which includes data types. The parameter variables will store the argument values passed into the constructor.

Constructors are said to be **overloaded** when there are multiple constructors, but the constructors have different signatures. They can differ in the number, type, and/or order of parameters.  For example, here are the two constructors for the ``Turtle`` class that take different parameters:

|Exercise| **Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: TurtleClass1
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: Turtle t = new Turtle();
   :answer_b: Turtle t = new Turtle(50,150);
   :answer_c: Turtle t = new Turtle(world1);
   :answer_d: Turtle t = new Turtle(world1,50,150);
   :answer_e: Turtle t = new Turtle(50,150,world1);
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: There is no Turtle constructor that takes no arguments according to the figure above.
   :feedback_b: There is no Turtle constructor that takes 2 arguments according to the figure above.
   :feedback_c: This would initialize the Turtle to the middle of the world, not necessarily coordinates (50,150).
   :feedback_d: Make sure the order of the arguments match the constructor signature above.
   :feedback_e: This matches the second constructor above with the parameters of x, y, and world.

   Given the Turtle class in the figure above and a World object world1, which of the following code segments will correctly create an instance of a Turtle object at (x,y) coordinates (50,150)?


In Unit 3, you will learn to write your own classes. However, if you see a class definition on the AP exam, like the one below for a class called ``Date``, you should be able to pick out the attributes (instance variables) and the constructors and know how to use them.

   :answer_e: Date d = new Date(2020,20,9);
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would initialize the date attributes to today's date according to the constructor comment above, which might not be Sept. 20, 2020.
   :feedback_b: There is no Date constructor that takes 2 arguments according to the figure above.
   :feedback_c: The comment for the second constructor in the Date class above says that the first argument must be the year.
   :feedback_d: This matches the second constructor above with the parameters year, month, day.
   :feedback_e: Make sure the order of the arguments match the constructor signature above.

   Given the ``Date`` class in the figure above and assuming that months in the ``Date`` class are numbered starting at 1, which of the following code segments will create a ``Date`` object for the date September 20, 2020 using the correct constructor?


Arguments, Parameters, and Call by Value
-----------------------------------------

When a constructor like ``Date(2005,9,1)`` is called, the **parameters**, (``year``, ``month``, and ``day``), are set to copies of the  **arguments**, (``2005``, ``9``, and ``1``).  This is **call by value** which means that copies of the argument values are passed to the constructor.  These values are used to initialize the object's attributes. A constructor call interrupts the sequential execution of statements in that the program executes the statements in the constructor before continuing. Once the last statement in the constructor has been executed, the flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the constructor was called.

.. figure:: Figures/parameterMappingDate.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :alt: Parameter Mapping
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 5: Parameter Mapping

The type of the values being passed in as arguments have to match the type of the parameter variables. We cannot give a constructor a ``String`` object when it is expecting an ``int``. The order of the arguments also matters. If you mix up the month and the day in the ``Date`` constructor, you will get a completely different date, for example January 9th (1/9) instead of Sept. 1st (9/1).

|Groupwork| Programming Challenge: Custom Turtles
---------------------------------------------------

Working in pairs, you will now look at a new class called CustomTurtle and design some colorful turtles with its constructors. The CustomTurtle class in the ActiveCode below inherits many of its attributes and methods from the Turtle class. However, it has some new constructors with more parameters to customize a turtle with its body color, shell color, width, and height. CustomTurtle has 3 constructors:

.. code-block:: java

  /** Constructs a CustomTurtle in the middle of the world */
  public CustomTurtle(World w)

  /** Constructs a CustomTurtle with a specific body color,
      shell color, and width and height in the middle of the world */
  public CustomTurtle(World w, Color body, Color shell, int w, int h)

  /** Constructs a CustomTurtle with a specific body color,
      shell color, and width and height at position (x,y) in the world */
  public CustomTurtle(int x, int y, World w, Color body, Color shell, int w, int h)


.. |Color| raw:: html

   <a href= "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html" target="_blank">Color</a>

You will use the constructor(s) to create the CustomTurtles below. You can specify colors like Color.red by using the |Color| class in Java.

1. Create a large 150x200 (width 150 and height 200) CustomTurtle with a green body (Color.green) and a blue shell (Color.blue) at position (150,300)

2. Create a small 25x50 CustomTurtle with a red body and a yellow shell at position (350,200)

Summary
-------------------

- (AP 1.13.A.1) A class contains **constructors** that are called with the keyword ``new`` to create objects and initialize its attributes. 

- (AP 1.13.A.1) **Constructors** have the same name as the class.

- (AP 1.13.C.1) An object is typically created using the keyword new followed by a call to one of the classâ€™s constructors. ``new ClassName()`` creates a new object of the specified class and calls a constructor.

- (AP 1.13.B.1) The new object is saved in a variable of a **reference type** which holds an object reference or null if there is no object.

- (AP 1.13.A.2) A **constructor signature** consists of the constructorâ€™s name, which is the same as the class name, and the ordered list of parameter types. 

- (AP 1.13.A.2) The **parameter list**, in the header of a constructor, lists the types of the values that are passed and their variable names.

- (AP 1.13.A.3) Constructors are said to be **overloaded** when there are multiple constructors with different signatures. They must differ in the number, type, or order of parameters.

- A **no-argument constructor** is a constructor that doesn't take any passed in values (arguments).

- (AP 1.13.C.2) **Parameters** allow constructors to accept values to establish the initial values of the attributes of the object.

- (AP 1.13.C.3) A constructor **argument** is a value that is passed into a constructor when the constructor is called. The arguments passed to a constructor must be compatible in order and number with the types identified in the parameter list in the constructor signature. 

- (AP 1.13.C.3) When calling constructors, arguments are passed using call by value. **Call by value** initializes the parameters with copies of the arguments.

- (AP 1.13.C.4) A constructor call interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to first execute the statements in the constructor before continuing. Once the last statement in the constructor has been executed, the flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where the constructor was called.
