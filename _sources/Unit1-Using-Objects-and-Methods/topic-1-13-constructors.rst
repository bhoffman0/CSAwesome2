Creating and Initializing Objects: Constructors
================================================

A Java class defines what objects of the class know (attributes) and what they can do (behaviors).  Each class has **constructors** like ``World()`` and ``Turtle(habitat)`` which are used to initialize the attributes in a newly created object.

A new object is created with the ``new`` keyword followed by the class name (``new Class()``).  When this code executes, it creates a new object of the specified class and calls a constructor, which has the same name as the class.  For example, ``new World()`` creates and initializes a new object of the ``World`` class, and ``new Turtle(habitat)`` creates and initializes a new ``Turtle`` object in the World habitat.


.. code-block:: java

    // To create a new object and call a constructor write:
    // ClassName variableName = new ClassName(parameters);
    World habitat = new World();    // create a new World object
    Turtle t = new Turtle(habitat); // create a new Turtle object

Overloading Constructors
---------------------------

There can be more than one constructor defined in a class. This is called **overloading** the constructor. There is usually a constructor that has no parameters (nothing inside the parentheses following the name of the constructor) like the ``World()`` constructor above.  This is also called the **no-argument constructor**.  The **no-argument** constructor usually sets the attributes of the object to default values.

There can also be other constructors that take parameters like the ``Turtle(habitat)`` constructor call above. A **parameter** (also called **actual parameter** or **argument**) is a value that is passed into a constructor.  It can be used to initialize the attribute of an object.

The ``World`` class actually has 2 constructors.  One doesn't take any parameters and one takes the world's width and height.

   :feedback_d: You must use the new keyword to create a new object.

   Which of these is valid syntax for creating and initializing a World object?

The World Class Constructors
----------------------------------------------------------

The constructor that doesn't take any parameters, ``World()``, creates a graphical window with 640x480 pixels. The ``World(int width, int height)`` constructor takes two integer parameters, and initializes the ``World`` object's width and height to them, for example ``new World(300,400)`` creates a 300x400 pixel world.

.. code-block:: java

    World world1 = new World(); // creates a 640x480 world
    World world2 = new World(300,400); // creates a 300x400 world

.. note::

   The turtle world does not use the Cartesian coordinate system with (0,0) in
   in the middle the screen. Instead, (0,0) is at the top left corner of the
   screen and x increases to the right and y increases towards the bottom of the
   screen.

   Most computer graphics systems use this coordinate system which is a carry
   over from before computers could display graphics. When computer displays
   were text based and mostly made by people using left-to-right, top-to-bottom
   languages like English, it made sense to have the first character appear at
   the top left and then count columns to the right and lines down.

.. figure:: Figures/coords.png
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 2: The coordinate (0,0) is at the top left of the Turtle world.

The Turtle Class Constructors
----------------------------------------------------------

The ``Turtle`` class also has multiple constructors, although it always requires a world as a parameter in order to have a place to draw the turtle. The default location for the turtle is right in the middle of the world.

There is another ``Turtle`` constructor that places the turtle at a certain (x,y) location in the world, for example at the coordinate (50, 100) below.

.. code-block:: java

    Turtle t1 = new Turtle(world1);
    Turtle t2 = new Turtle(50, 100, world1);

.. note::
   Notice that the order of the parameters matter. The ``Turtle`` constructor takes ``(x,y,world)`` as parameters in that order. If you mix up the order of the parameters it will cause an error, because the parameters will not be the data types that it expects. This is one reason why programming languages have data types -- to allow for error-checking.

        }
    }

Object Variables and References
---------------------------------

You can also declare an **object variable** and initialize it to **null** (``Turtle t1 = null;``). An object variable holds a **reference** to an object.  A **reference** is a way to find the object in memory. It is like a tracking number that you can use to track the location of a package.

.. |video1| raw:: html

Watch the |video1| below about null.

.. youtube:: 5fpjgXAV2BU
    :width: 650
    :height: 415
    :align: center

The code ``Turtle t1 = null;`` creates a variable ``t1`` that refers to a ``Turtle`` object, but the ``null`` means that it doesn't refer to an object yet. You could later create the object and set the object variable to refer to that new object (``t1 = new Turtle(world1)``).  Or more commonly, you can declare an object variable and initialize it in the same line of code (``Turtle t2 = new Turtle(world1);``).

.. code-block:: java

    World world1 = new World();
    Turtle t1 = null;
    t1 = new Turtle(world1);
    // declare and initialize t2
    Turtle t2 = new Turtle(world1);




Constructor Signatures
-----------------------------------

.. |turtle documentation| raw:: html

   <a href="https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/doc/Turtle.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">documentation</a>

When you use a class that someone has already written for you in a **library** that you can import like the ``Turtle`` class above, you can look up how to use the constructors and methods in the |turtle documentation| for that class.  The documentation will list the **signatures** (or headers) of the constructors or methods which will tell you their name and parameter list. The **parameter list**, in the **header** of a constructor, lists the **formal parameters**, declaring the variables that will be passed in as values and their data types.

Constructors are **overloaded** when there are multiple constructors, but the constructors have different signatures. They can differ in the number, type, and/or order of parameters.  For example, here are two constructors for the ``Turtle`` class that take different parameters:

|Exercise| **Check your understanding**

   :answer_a: Turtle t = new Turtle();
   :answer_b: Turtle t = new Turtle(50,150);
   :answer_c: Turtle t = new Turtle(world1);
   :answer_d: Turtle t = new Turtle(world1,50,150);
   :answer_e: Turtle t = new Turtle(50,150,world1);
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: There is no Turtle constructor that takes no parameters according to the figure above.
   :feedback_b: There is no Turtle constructor that takes 2 parameters according to the figure above.
   :feedback_c: This would initialize the Turtle to the middle of the world, not necessarily coordinates (50,150).
   :feedback_d: Make sure the order of the parameters match the constructor signature above.
   :feedback_e: This matches the second constructor above with the parameters of x, y, and world.

   Given the Turtle class in the figure above and a World object world1, which of the following code segments will correctly create an instance of a Turtle object at (x,y) coordinates (50,150)?

.. mchoice:: no_arg_constructor
   :practice: T
   :answer_a: public World(int width, int height)
   :answer_b: public World()
   :answer_c: public World
   :answer_d: public World(int width)
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This constructor signature defines two arguments: width and height.
   :feedback_b: This constructor signature is correct for a no-argument constructor.
   :feedback_c: The constructor signature must include parentheses.
   :feedback_d: This constructor signature defines one argument: width.

   Which of these is the correct signature for a no-argument constructor?

In Unit 5, you will learn to write your own classes. However, if you see a class definition on the AP exam, like the one below for a class called ``Date``, you should be able to pick out the attributes (instance variables) and the constructors and know how to use them.

   :answer_d: Date d = new Date(2020,9,20);
   :answer_e: Date d = new Date(2020,20,9);
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would initialize the date attributes to today's date according to the constructor comment above, which might not be Sept. 20, 2020.
   :feedback_b: There is no Date constructor that takes 2 parameters according to the figure above.
   :feedback_c: The comment for the second constructor in the Date class above says that the first parameter must be the year.
   :feedback_d: This matches the second constructor above with the parameters year, month, day.
   :feedback_e: Make sure the order of the parameters match the constructor signature above.

   Given the ``Date`` class in the figure above and assuming that months in the ``Date`` class are numbered starting at 1, which of the following code segments will create a ``Date`` object for the date September 20, 2020 using the correct constructor?


Formal and Actual Parameters
--------------------------------

When a constructor like ``Date(2005,9,1)`` is called, the **formal parameters**, (year, month, day), are set to copies of the  **actual parameters** (or **arguments**), which are (2005,9,1).  This is **call by value** which means that copies of the actual parameter values are passed to the constructor.  These values are used to initialize the object's attributes.

.. figure:: Figures/parameterMappingDate.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :alt: Parameter Mapping
    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 5: Parameter Mapping

The type of the values being passed in as arguments have to match the type of the formal parameter variables. We cannot give a constructor a ``String`` object when it is expecting an ``int``. The order of the arguments also matters. If you mix up the month and the day in the ``Date`` constructor, you will get a completely different date, for example January 9th (1/9) instead of Sept. 1st (9/1).

    }

The CustomTurtle class in the ActiveCode below inherits many of its attributes and methods from the Turtle class (you will learn more about inheritance in Unit 9). However, it has some new constructors with more parameters to customize a turtle with its body color, shell color, width, and height. CustomTurtle has 3 constructors:

.. code-block:: java

  /** Constructs a CustomTurtle in the middle of the world */
  public CustomTurtle(World w)

  /** Constructs a CustomTurtle with a specific body color,
      shell color, and width and height in the middle of the world */
  public CustomTurtle(World w, Color body, Color shell, int w, int h)

  /** Constructs a CustomTurtle with a specific body color,
      shell color, and width and height at position (x,y) in the world */
  public CustomTurtle(int x, int y, World w, Color body, Color shell, int w, int h)


.. |Color| raw:: html

   <a href= "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html" target="_blank">Color</a>

You will use the constructor(s) to create the CustomTurtles below. You can specify colors like Color.red by using the |Color| class in Java.

1. Create a large 150x200 (width 150 and height 200) CustomTurtle with a green body (Color.green) and a blue shell (Color.blue) at position (150,300)

2. Create a small 25x50 CustomTurtle with a red body and a yellow shell at position (350,200)

Summary
-------------------


- **Constructors** initialize the attributes in newly created objects.  They have the same name as the class.

- A **constructor signature** is the constructor name followed by the parameter list which is a list of the types of the parameters and the variable names used to refer to them in the constructor.

- **Overloading** is when there is more than one constructor.  They must differ in the number, type, or order of parameters.

- **New** is a keyword that is used to create a new object of a class.  The syntax is ``new ClassName()``.  It creates a new object of the specified class and calls a constructor.

- A **no-argument constructor** is a constructor that doesn't take any passed in values (arguments).

- **Parameters** allow values to be passed to the constructor to initialize the newly created object's attributes.

- The **parameter list**, in the header of a constructor, is a list of the type of the value being passed and a variable name. These variables are called the **formal parameters**.

- **Actual parameters** are the values being passed to a constructor.  The formal parameters are set to a copy of the value of the actual parameters.

- **Formal parameters** are the specification of the parameters in the constructor header.  In Java this is a list of the type and name for each parameter (``World(int width, int height``).

- **Call by value** means that when you pass a value to a constructor or method it passes a copy of the value.

   :answer_e: II and III
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: I is one of the correct constructors but the second constructor can also be used.
   :feedback_b: II is not correct because there is no Cat constructor that takes 2 parameters.
   :feedback_c: I and III call the correct constructors.
   :feedback_d: II is not correct because there is no Cat constructor that takes 2 parameters.
   :feedback_e: II is not correct because there is no Cat constructor that takes 2 parameters.

    Consider the following class. Which of the following successfully creates a new Cat object?
