**How did he get into computing?**

*"I was always interested in video games as a kid. And I thought that was a very magical thing. But my dad also was a system administrator at Boeing. So, he helped me build my own computer and give me access to computers at a really young age. I think those two influences were probably the main things that got me really interested in computers."*

**What kind of company does he work at?**

*"I work at a startup, and I started as employee number three. Now we're at over 200 employees. Th[e] ability to have agency and ownership [at a startup] was very powerful for me."*

Brian started out by working at IBM, a large firm. He eventually transitioned to a start-up because he enjoyed the greater freedom and autonomy there.

**What keeps him in computing?**

*"There is some level of motivation now around teaching others... There's the level of understanding where you can work or do something, and then there's a level of understanding that you actually need to be able to effectively articulate that to someone. There's a slight difference. And it also just allows you to see it from a new perspective."*


**What subfield is he interested in?**

*"I came from doing a very different kind of programming to doing web development. I didn't know what I was doing, and a lot of it was learning."*

Bryan is currently a manager, but he started with his company as a web developer. He actually entered the industry as a low-level, database programmer. Once he joined his current company, he made the transition to web development.
