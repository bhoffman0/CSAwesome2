About the AP CSA Exam
======================

This curriculum will prepare you for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A
Exam which tests your programming skills in Java.

The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections—multiple choice and
free-response. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
first part has 40 multiple-choice questions, and the second part has 4 free
response questions where you have to write Java code by hand. Each part is worth
50% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the |AP CSA
Reference Sheet|.

The 4 free response questions cover the following areas (from `AP CSA Free Response <https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/assessment>`_):

  - **Question 1**: Methods and Control Structures—You’ll be asked to write program
    code to create objects of a class and call methods, and satisfy method
    specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative
    statements.

  - **Question 2**: Classes—You’ll be asked to write program code to define a new
    type by creating a class and satisfy method specifications using
    expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements.

  - **Question 3**: Array/ArrayList—You’ll be asked to write program code to satisfy
    method specifications and create, traverse, and manipulate elements in 1D
    array or ArrayList objects.

  - **Question 4**: 2D Array—You’ll be asked to write program code to satisfy method
    specifications and create, traverse, and manipulate elements in 2D array
    objects.

The College Board specifies the AP CSA course in the 10 units shown in the table
below. On the College Board's AP Portal they provide formative assessments
called Personal Progress Checks for each unit. This CSAwesome curriculum is
organized around the AP CSA units and also provides many interactive exercises
in each unit.

The College Board also requires AP CSA courses to provide at least 20 hours of
lab time for you to practice Java programming.
