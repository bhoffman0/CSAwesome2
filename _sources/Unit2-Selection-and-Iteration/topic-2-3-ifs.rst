if Statements
=================

.. index::
   single: selection
   single: if
   single: else

**If statements** are found in all programming languages as a way to choose between different paths in an algorithm. An if statement is a type of **selection** statement that changes the sequential execution. It affects the flow of control by executing different segments of code based on the value of a **Boolean expression**.

If you took an AP CSP course or used a block programming language like Scratch, you've probably seen if blocks or statements before.  Here's a comparison of ifs in App Inventor blocks, AP CSP block code and pseudocode, and Java ifs.

    Figure 1: Comparison of App Inventor if block, AP CSP ifs, and Java if statements

One-way selection
------------------

A one-way selection (if statement) is used when there is a segment of code (called the **body** of the if statement) to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body is executed only when the Boolean expression is true. If the Boolean expression is false, the body of the if statement is skipped and the program continues with the next statement after the if statement.


.. figure:: Figures/Condition.png

    :figclass: align-center

    Figure 2: The order that statements execute in a conditional

The open curly brace ``{`` and a close curly brace ``}`` are used to group a block of statements together as the body of the if statement.  It is recommended to always put in the curly braces even if you have just one statement under the if statement. The questions you will see on the AP exam will use curly braces.

.. code-block:: java

    // A single if statement
    if (boolean expression)
        Do statement;
    // Or a single if with {}
    if (boolean expression)
    {
       Do statement;
    }
    // A block if statement: { } required
    if (boolean expression)
    {
       Do Statement1;
       Do Statement2;
       ...
       Do StatementN;
    }

.. note::

    Note that there is no semicolon (;) at the end of the boolean expression in an if statement even if it is the end of that line. The semicolon goes at the end of the whole if statement, often on the next line. Or { } are used to mark the beginning and end of the block of code under the if condition.

Imagine that your cell phone wanted to remind you to take an umbrella if it was currently raining in your area when it detected that you were leaving the house.  This type of thing is going to become more common in the future and it is an area of research called Human Computer Interaction (HCI) or Ubiquitous Computing (computers are everywhere).

.. activecode:: if-raining
   :language: java
   :autograde: unittest

   The variable ``isRaining`` is a boolean variable that is either true or false. If it is true then the message ``Take an umbrella!`` will be printed and then execution will continue with the next statement which will print ``Drive carefully``. Run the code below to see this.
   ~~~~
   public class Test1
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           boolean isRaining = true;
           if (isRaining)
           {
               System.out.println("Take an umbrella!");
           }
           System.out.println("Drive carefully");
       }
   }

           String expect = "Take an umbrella! \nDrive carefully";
           boolean passed = getResults(expect, output, "Expected output from main");
           assertTrue(passed);
       }
   }

.. fillintheblank:: iffalseOutput

   Try changing the code above to ``boolean isRaining = false;``.  What will it print?

   -    :^Drive carefully$: Correct.  If the boolean is false, it will skip executing the print statement after the if.

Relational Operators in If Statements
---------------------------------------

Most if statements have a boolean condition that uses relational operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, as we saw in the last lesson.

.. note::

    A common mistake in if statements is using = instead of == in the condition by mistake. You should always **use ==**, not =, in the condition of an if statement to test a variable. One equal sign (=) assigns a value to a variable, and two equal signs (==) test if a variable has a certain value.

Two-way selection
------------------

What if you want to pick between two possibilities?  If you are trying to decide between a couple of things to do, you might flip a coin and do one thing if it lands as heads and another if it is tails.  In programming, you can use the **if** keyword followed by a statement or block of statements and then the **else** keyword also followed by a statement or block of statements.


.. code-block:: java

    // A block if/else statement
    if (boolean expression)
    {
       statement1;
       statement2;
    }
    else
    {
       do other statement;
       and another one;
    }

.. code-block:: java

    // A single if/else statement
    if (boolean expression)
        Do statement;
    else
        Do other statement;


A two-way selection (if-else statement) is used when there are two segments of code—one to be executed when the Boolean expression is true and another segment for when the Boolean expression is false. In this case, the body of the if is executed when the Boolean expression is true, and the body of the else is executed when the Boolean expression is false.

The following flowchart demonstrates that if the condition (the boolean expression) is true, one block of statements is executed, but if the condition is false, a different block of statements inside the else clause is executed.

               System.out.println("Let's watch a movie");
           }

Math.random() in if Statements
-------------------------------

The ``Math.random()`` method returns a random number between 0.0 and 1.0.  You can use this method with ``if`` statements to simulate a coin flip or an event occuring a certain percentage of the time. For example, if you want to simulate a coin flip, you can check if the random number is less than 0.5 (halfway between 0 and 1) to simulate a 50% chance of heads or tails:

.. code-block:: java

    if (Math.random() < 0.5)
    {
        System.out.println("Heads");
    }
    else
    {
        System.out.println("Tails");
    }

If you want to simulate an event occuring 90% of the time, you can check the random number to see if it is less than 0.9 (90% of the way between 0 and 1):

.. code-block:: java

    if (Math.random() < 0.9)
    {
        // 90% of the time
        System.out.println("Event happened");
    }
    else 
    {
        // 10% of the time
        System.out.println("Event did not happen");
    }

   The weather report says there is approximately 25% chance of rain today. Which of the following if statements would print Rain or No Rain to simulate a day with the correct percentages following the weather report? 

   -  .. code-block:: java
        
         if (Math.random() < 0.25) { System.out.println("Rain"); }
       
      + Correct! This code will print "Rain" 25% of the time.

   -  .. code-block:: java
        
         if (Math.random() > 0.75) { System.out.println("Rain"); }

      + Correct. This code will print "Rain" 25% (1 - .75) of the time.

   -  .. code-block:: java
       
         if (Math.random() > 0.25) { System.out.println("Rain"); }

      - Incorrect. This code will print "Rain" 75% of the time.

   -  .. code-block:: java
        
         if (Math.random() < 0.75) { System.out.println("No Rain"); }

      + Correct! This code will print "No Rain" 75% of the time, so it will rain 25% of the time.

Common Errors with If Statements
---------------------------------

Here are some rules to follow with if statements to avoid some common errors:

   - Always use curly braces (``{`` and ``}``) to enclose the block of statements under the if condition. Java doesn't care if you indent the code—it goes by the ``{ }``.

   - Don't put in a semicolon ``;`` after the first line of the if statement, ``if (test);``. The ``if`` statement is a multiline block of code that starts with the ``if`` condition and then ``{`` the body of the if statement ``}``.

   - Always use ``==``, not ``=``, in the condition of an if statement to test a variable. One ``=`` assigns, two ``==`` tests!

   - The ``else`` statement matches with the closest ``if`` statement. If you want to match an ``else`` with a different ``if`` statement, you need to use curly braces to group the ``if`` and ``else`` together.

Summary
-------

- (AP 2.3.A.1) Selection statements change the sequential execution of statements.

- (AP 2.3.A.2) An **if statement** is a type of selection statement that affects the flow of control by executing different segments of code based on the value of a Boolean expression.

- (AP 2.3.A.3) A one-way selection (if statement) is used when there is a segment of code to execute under a certain condition. In this case, the body is executed only when the Boolean expression is true.

- **if statements** test a boolean expression and if it is true, go on to execute the body which is the following statement or block of statements surrounded by curly braces  (``{}``) like below.

.. code-block:: java

    // A single if statement
    if (boolean expression)
        Do statement;
    // A block if statement
    if (boolean expression)
    {
       Do Statement1;
       Do Statement2;
       ...
       Do StatementN;
    }

- Relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) are used in boolean expressions to compare values and arithmetic expressions.

- If statements can be followed by an associated **else** part to form a 2-way branch:

.. code-block:: java

    if (boolean expression)
    {
        Do statement;
    }
    else
    {
        Do other statement;
    }

- (AP 2.3.A.4) A two-way selection (if-else statement) is used when there are two segments of code—one to be executed when the Boolean expression is true and another segment for when the Boolean expression is false. In this case, the body of the if is executed when the Boolean expression is true, and the body of the else is executed when the Boolean expression is false.

AP Practice
------------

.. mchoice:: AP2-3-1
    :practice: T

    Consider the following code segment.

    .. code-block:: java

        int speed = 35;
        boolean rain = false;

        if (rain)
        {
           speed -= 10;
        }

        if (rain == false)
        {
          speed += 5;
        }

        if (speed > 35)
        {
           speed = speed - 2;
        }

        System.out.println(speed);


    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

    - 28

      - Some of the if statement conditions are false so they will not run.

    - 35

      - Take a look at the changes to speed in the if statements.

    - 38

      + Correct! The first if statement condition is false, and the second and third if conditions are true.

    - 25

      - The first if statement would only run if rain is true.

    - 33

      - The second if statement would run since rain is false.



.. mchoice:: AP2-3-2
    :practice: T

    Consider the following code segment.

    .. code-block:: java

        int x = 5;

        if (x < 5)
        {
           x = 3 * x;
        }

        if (x % 2 == 1)
        {
           x = x / 2;
        }

        System.out.print(2*x + 1);

    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

    - 3

      - Take a look at the second if statement again!

    - 11

      - Take a look at the second if statement again!

    - 31

      - The first if statement condition is false.

    - 15

      - The first if statement condition is false.

    - 5

      + Correct! The first if statement is not true. The second one is true since 5 is odd, and x becomes 2. And 2*2 + 1 = 5 is printed out.


.. mchoice:: AP2-3-if-else
    :practice: T

    Consider the following code segment where a range of "High", "Middle", or "Low" is being determined
    where x is an int and a "High" is 80 and above, a "Middle" is between 50 - 79, and "Low" is below 50.

    .. code-block:: java

        if (x >= 80)
        {
           System.out.println("High");
        }

        if (x >= 50)
        {
          System.out.println("Middle");
        }
        else
        {
           System.out.println("Low");
        }

    Which of the following initializations for *x* will demonstrate that the code segment will not work as intended?

    - 80

      + This would print out both "High" and "Middle", showing that there is an error in the code. As you will see in the next lesson, one way to fix the code is to add another else in front of the second if.

    - 60

      - This would correctly print out "Middle".

    - 50

      - This would correctly print out "Middle".

    - 30

      - This would print out "Low" which is correct according to this problem description.

    - -10

      - This would print out "Low" which is correct according to this problem description.
