# Authors

CSAwesome was based on the Java Review ebook written by Barbara Ericson of University of Michigan @ericsonga, and revised and reorganized by Beryl Hoffman of Elms College and the Mobile CSP project in 2019 for the 2019 AP CSA exam as CSAwesome. Kate McDonnell from Cherry Creek Schools created a JUnit test code suite in 2020 to provide feedback to students in every active code. Peter Seibel from Berkeley High School joined the authors and developers in 2023. Many others have contributed. For the most up to date listing of who has contributed to the ebook see the Preface.
